It is led by**School of Medicine Principal Investigators**(PIs);**AND**,\n2. It involves either the targeted enrollment of**UW Medicine patients, OR**use of**[UW Medicine Data] **. Note that UW Medicine Data is NOT limited to clinical records and includes many types of data stored in any UW Medicine system or application.\nThis guidance is intended to align with the[UW Medicine Policy on Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Healthcare Setting] and uses the definitions of AI and UW Medicine Data from the glossary of this policy. It covers both research involving the development of AI systems and the use of AI as a tool to facilitate the administration of a research study (e.g., recruitment, safety monitoring, data analysis).**Exception**: This guidance does not apply to the use of AI as tool for the administration of research when: 1) the AI tool(s) have been approved for use in clinical care and UW medicine business operations as described in UW Medicine&#8217;s policy**and**2) are being used for their approved purpose.\nHSD has revised its interpretation of the regulatory definition of a human subject to capture some research that should be reviewed by the IRB to mitigate the risks to subjects that may result from re-identification of their data. This means that IRB review will be required for some research involving AI and the secondary use of**de-identified data**that did not previously require IRB review. Use the[Human Subjects Research Determination worksheet] to determine if your research requires IRB review.\nFor research covered by this guidance, the UW IRB now requires researchers to complete and submit the[SUPPLEMENT Artificial Intelligence] form with their IRB application. The supplement is designed to be used with this guidance to develop and describe a plan to address the risks associated with research involving the use of AI, and to provide the IRB with the information necessary to complete its review of the risk mitigation plan.\nWhen the research will**not**involve data collection through interaction with research participants (e.g. it involves only use of secondary data), the supplement may be submitted in conjunction with the*shorter*[IRB Protocol, No Contact form]. Otherwise, the[standard IRB Protocol form] should be used.\n[Back to Table of Contents] \n## Context\nAI systems introduce unique and evolving risks when used in human research, stemming from their complexity, scale, and unpredictability. Unlike traditional technologies, AI can produce outputs that are fabricated, difficult to interpret, or that reflect and amplify societal biases. These systems may also re-identify individuals from datasets previously considered de-identified or reveal sensitive information, raising concerns about equity, participant safety, privacy, and confidentiality. Adaptive AI, which continues to learn and evolve based on new data or interactions, introduces additional challenges, such as performance drift, unpredictable behavior, and difficulty in validating outputs over time. These characteristics can complicate informed consent, challenge participant autonomy, obscure accountability, and increase the likelihood of evolving risks that may not be foreseeable at the outset of a study.\nThis guidance is designed to establish a standardized and risk-based approach to the review of research involving AI that will help the IRB identify the risks in a study, determine when risks have been appropriately mitigated, and communicate the IRBs expectations to researchers.\nThe approach in this guidance is largely based on the white paper[A Novel, Streamlined Approach to the IRB Review of Artificial Intelligence Human Subjects Research (AI HSR)] and the[Multi-Regional Clinical Trials Center&#8217;s (MRCT) Framework for Review of Clinical Research Involving Artificial Intelligence]. Both the white paper and the MRCT framework call for the IRB to consider the stages of AI development when determining the level of oversight and risk mitigations measures required. The guidance also draws extensively from the[Taxonomy of Trustworthiness for Artificial Intelligence] and the[National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework], as well as relevant FDA guidance and presentations from various IRB forums.\n[Back to Table of Contents] \n## Role of the IRB\nThe UW IRB ensures that research involving AI adheres to the three fundamental ethical principles described in the[Belmont Report]:**Beneficence**,**Justice**and**Respect for Persons**. These principles are applied through the established regulatory criteria for IRB approval of research. As the unique and evolving risks introduced by AI technologies present new ethical challenges, the purpose of this section is to explain how the UW IRB interprets and applies both the Belmont Principles and federal human subjects regulations in the context of AI research. The UW IRB will also use the information in the remaining sections of this document to guide its review.\n**Beneficence.**\n**Regulatory Criteria:**\n* Risks to subjects are minimized by using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.\n* Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result.\n* There is an adequate plan for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.\n* There is an adequate plan to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.\n**IRB review:**\n* Evaluates whether the research plan includes sufficient measures to reduce harm that may result from AI system issues, such as inaccurate misleading system outputs, performance drift, lack of transparency in decision-making processes, the potential for overreliance on AI, and limited explainability of system outputs, and the risk of AI systems retaining or disclosing information beyond their intended scope.\n* Evaluates whether the potential benefits of AI research justify the risks, including the potential for AI to cause individual harm in a clinical setting and the potential benefits of AI for individuals in clinical setting and broadly for improvement/scalability of medical care.\n* Evaluates whether there are sufficient data monitoring and feedback systems to detect and mitigate adverse effects that may be caused by errors, biases, or unexpected behaviors.\n* Evaluates whether there are sufficient privacy and security measures built into the AI system design, testing, deployment, and operation.\n**Justice.**\n**Regulatory Criteria:**\n* Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted.\n**IRB review:**\n* Evaluates whether there are sufficient measures in place to assess and mitigate computational bias (including biased input data and biased model design) so that underrepresented populations are not unfairly excluded, disproportionately affected, or disenfranchised by AI-driven decisions.\n* Encourages equitable distribution of research benefits and burdens across populations.\n**Respect for Persons.**\n**Regulatory Criteria:**\n* The IRB ensures that informed consent will be obtained from each participant (or their legally authorized representative) before they participate in the research, unless the research qualifies for a waiver of the consent requirements.\n* The IRB ensures that consent will be appropriately documented unless the research qualifies for a waiver of the requirement for documented consent.\n**IRB review:**\n* Verifies that consent processes are clearly documented and that waivers are justified when applicable.\n* Ensures that the consent materials clearly explain the role of AI in the study, how data will be used, describes the risks and limitations of the AI system, the safeguards that will be in place, and how any results will be returned to participants.\n[Back to Table of Contents] \n## IRB Review and Stage of Development or use of AI\nThe questions in the[SUPPLEMENT Artificial Intelligence] are structured around the stage of development of the AI system, and the use of AI as a tool to facilitate the administration of a research study. Breaking the review process down into the stages of development allows for a more targeted and efficient evaluation of AI-related clinical research by addressing the specific challenges and considerations at each stage. Researchers can use the information and resources provided in the[Identifying and Assessing Risks] section to help them complete the supplement and the information in the[Consent Considerations] section to design the consent process.\nFor research involving the development",

The UW has a responsibility to lead in the conversation around AI – not only in potential applications but in their ethical and equitable use. To meet the challenges and opportunities that AI represents, Provost Tricia Serio and President Ana Mari Cauce appointed a [Task Force on Artificial Intelligence] to suggest a UW-wide strategy for AI earlier this year.\n\n## Charge to the AI Task Force\n\nCharged with preparing a comprehensive vision and strategy, the AI Task Force developed a range of proposals covering every aspect of university life and work with and for our local and global communities, guided by the following principles and assumptions:\n\n- The UW has a responsibility to lead in the conversation around AI — not only in potential applications, but in their ethical and equitable use.\n- The responsible use of AI requires a basic understanding of AI.\n- Incorporating faculty, staff, and students is important and consistent with the University of Washington’s mission to preserve, advance and disseminate knowledge and prepare students for a future where AI will be an integral part of their professional and personal lives.\n\nThe task force carried out its charge with five working groups:\n\n- Research and Knowledge Creation/Transfer\n- Student Services\n- Teaching and Learning\n- Infrastructure\n- Administration\n\n## The WAISTAR framework\n\nBuilding on proposals submitted by the working groups, the task force developed a framework integrating vision and strategy. The **Washington AI Initiative for Society, Teaching, and Research**(WAISTAR) focuses on key areas of Education, Research, Student Experience, and Operations, to address a wide range of ways to enable AI through training, community, infrastructure, expertise and collaborations, as well as the necessary investment and governance to create a visionary and sustainable AI strategy at the UW. WAISTAR is a framework that can accelerate the UW’s considerable strength in AI and associated disciplines at the center of the UW’s and UW students’ futures, in service to the public good.\n\n## We’re in this together\n\nThis vision is not just an outcome of the AI Task Force; it’s a way for the entire institution to move forward into an AI-empowered future. To learn more and join the conversation, please take some time to review an abbreviated version of the [AI Task Force recommendations in narrative]  or [slide format]. This version is a summary of the initial report to the provost, highlighting key recommendations and a long-term vision for the UW to lead a human-centered, AI-fueled transformation in teaching, learning, research and operations. **[Share your feedback and input via an institution-wide survey] ** that is open until 5 p.m., Oct. 25.\n\n## Other ways to get involved\n\nPlease join us to learn more about AI at the UW with a weekly series of town halls from late October through early December.\n\nWe begin on **[Thursday, October 24, with “What is AI?”] ** that is designed to build a shared understanding of AI’s foundations, opportunities, potential, and risks. This session will set the stage for future discussions by demystifying AI and exploring how it may impact our work, research and daily lives.\n\nThe next session will be **Wed., Oct. 30 on “AI for Research and Research in AI.”** Scheduling is underway for the following town halls and details will be announced soon.\n\n- AI for Student Success\n- AI for Education\n- AI for Teaching and Learning\n- AI Infrastructure\n- AI for Administration\n\nEach town hall will explore a different aspect of the future of AI at the UW and will include a moderated question and response session where everyone is encouraged to share their perspectives. All town halls will start at noon PST and end at 1:20 p.m. [Check back here next week] for the YouTube link that will give you access.\n\nWe look forward to your participation and input as we create this future together!\n\nOne of the joys of an academic career is the freedom to explore what intrigues us. We have the agency to become experts in the fields of our own choosing, to self-direct our collaborations, discoveries, innovations, and creations and to follow a line of inquiry wherever it leads. We also have the unparalleled privilege to continuously integrate our knowledge and perspectives with those of our students through our partnership with them in teaching and learning, as both instructors and mentors.\n\nAs President Cauce noted in her recent [communication about expectations and responsibilities of our UW community], our contributions to the mission of our University and thereby the world flow directly from this foundation of academic freedom and free speech. As I suspect is true of many of you, I have chosen this profession because I believe deeply in the importance of these freedoms for the common good and have personally experienced their positive impact through my own education, teaching, research, service and outreach.\n\nWe begin a new academic year during a time of significant discord and conflict across the globe and in the midst of an upcoming election. It is my hope that we can draw together to not only protect but also uphold these freedoms as our collective responsibility and to ensure that they are available to all members of our University. I ask each one of us to pursue this responsibility with intentionality throughout our academic activities and particularly in our courses.\n\nIn support of this work, I am writing to share a few reminders and resources.\n\n**Inclusive Learning Environment**\n\nAs faculty and instructors, you are the trusted subject matter experts, who embody our educational mission. The [ethics of our profession], the Faculty Code ( [Section 24-33]) and [federal regulations] detail both our rights and responsibilities to ensure an environment that supports learning for all students. These balanced responsibilities also ensure that all learners have access to the same rights in their educational environments. As detailed in the Faculty Code, key components of our responsibilities include:\n\n- respecting the dignity of others\n- acknowledging the right to express differing opinions\n- presenting the subject matter of our courses as approved by the faculty in their collective responsibility for the curriculum\n- evaluating students based on academic performance alone\n- refraining from:\n - coercion of students to make a particular personal choice as to political action or their own roles in society\n - harassment or discrimination\n\nIn ensuring these principles, we must be particularly mindful of the positionality of our students even as we engage them as partners in learning. I encourage you to explore the following resources to intentionally and transparently create and maintain an inclusive learning environment:\n\n- [Teaching@UW] advice on [facilitating class conversations] \n- Faculty Senate [workshop]  on academic freedom and free speech in the classroom\n- [Civil Discourse in the Classroom] \n- [Tips for Nurturing a Climate of Free Expression and Inclusion] \n\nIn parallel, we are supporting students to further develop their own skills in dialogue across differences through First Year Programs and LEAD 298C “2024: Dialogue, Disagreement, and Democracy” offered by Vice Provost and Dean Ed Taylor across our three campuses. Additional information can be found at [https://dialogue.uw.edu].\n\n**Election**\n\nAs employees of the state of Washington, we are all bound by the regulations in the [Ethics in Public Service Act]. Information on our responsibilities can be found on the [Internal Audit website] and includes restrictions on using state resources:\n\n- To assist a campaign\n- To promote or oppose a ballot initiative\n- To lobby the state legislature\n\nI encourage you to participate in the many opportunities for learning about elections across our University this fall, many of which will be listed on the [Office of the Provost’s website] later this week. I especially call your attention to the lecture series “Democracy in Focus: Navigating the 2024 Election” that is co-sponsored by my office and the College of Arts & Sciences, occurring each Tuesday leading up to election day and culminating the week after, the [Public Lecture Series] sponsored by the Graduate School, and a [resource guide] developed by the Libraries.\n\nStudent Life and the Office of Minority Affairs and Diversity will also be offering programming and information for students to support their engagement with the democratic process.\n\nFinally, I want to stress the importance of your own well-being in these challenging times. [The Whole U] offers many resources to support and promote faculty and staff well-being. I encourage you to not only explore these resources but also prioritize time to care for yourself.\n\nI thank you for all that you do for the University of Washington. Your voice and contributions collectively define our excellence as an institution. Please join me in ensuring that we protect this opportunity for everyone.\n\nOne of the many things that drew me here was the University’s deep commitment to the concept of an R1 university, where excellence in scholarship and creative activity and in teaching are valued and integrated to strengthen",

    "text": "UW Engineering's AI and content guidelines | UW College of Engineering\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) offers powerful tools that can support content creation — helping us develop and edit copy, brainstorm ideas, write captions, tighten up social posts and more. But because generative AI is trained on existing data, we must use it carefully to avoid plagiarism, misinformation and bland or off-brand messaging.\n\nThe College's Marketing and Communications team has developed the following guidelines for responsible AI use when developing and managing written and visual content.\n\nWhat can I use AI for? What shouldn't I use AI for? Is it ok to use AI-generated images? How do I ensure I’m using AI properly? Additional resources\n\n## What can I use AI for?\n\nAI can support many stages of the content development, posting and publishing process. Examples include:\n\n### Content brainstorming and drafting\n\n- Reword or shorten content for clarity, tone or specific audiences or placement\n- Suggest ideas for image subject matter and photo shoots\n- Design quiz or survey questions\n- Suggest titles, subheads, alt text or short-form copy\n- Brainstorm interview questions\n- Generate social posts and story ideas, angles and outlines\n\n### Organizing information and workflows\n\n- Assist with task planning (for example, setting production schedules or managing content calendars)\n- Transcribe notes from an interview\n- Paraphrase technical content or explain complex concepts\n- Organize background material or data from multiple sources\n- Summarize documents, meeting notes or interviews\n\n### Polishing and refining content\n\n- Assist with simple image tasks like resizing photos or expanding generic backgrounds\n- Review from different users’ perspectives\n- Suggest alternative word choices\n- Identify unclear phrasing or problematic terminology\n- Adjust tone and style for consistency\n- Check grammar, spelling, punctuation and readability\n\nNo matter the task, remember: AI output should always be reviewed and verified by a human before sharing externally.\n\n### Did AI write it?\n\nTools like Grammarly, ZeroGPT, Scribbr and Quillbot can help assess whether text was likely generated by AI.\n\n## What shouldn't I use AI for?\n\nAI can assist us in our work, but it also has limitations:\n\n- It may compromise privacy – Don’t upload sensitive or confidential information into AI tools.\n- It can be biased – AI may reflect or amplify harmful biases present in its training data.\n- It can manipulate and create false quotations – Even if you tell it not to, AI may still adjust quoted material in your draft copy. It may also create new quoted material and attribute it to your subject.\n- It lacks depth – While useful for straightforward tasks, AI struggles with nuance, complexity and high-stakes writing.\n- It can be boring – AI often produces generic, flat copy.\n- It can hallucinate – AI may generate content that sounds plausible but isn’t accurate.\n\nSo, avoid using AI for tasks that require human judgment, originality or involve sensitive information.\n\n### Specifically, do not use AI to:\n\n- Replace human input where nuance, empathy or creativity are essential\n- Create or edit content without the subject’s or author’s consent\n- Fact-check information\n- Analyze or process private, sensitive or confidential content\n- Generate and add new elements into an image (note: generic background fills are fine)\n- Create entire pieces of original text, video, audio or images\n\n### Caution: Sensitive or private information\n\nIt is critical that we do not input any sensitive or private information into AI tools. This includes personal details (such as contact information, student or donor records), confidential or embargoed content, or proprietary data. Once entered into an AI system, this information may be stored, used to further train the model, or become accessible in ways we cannot control—creating risks for privacy, security and compliance.\n\n## Is it ok to use AI-generated images?\n\nThe College’s Marketing & Communications team avoids using AI-generated images — especially in high-visibility areas like the website homepage, publication covers and similar contexts.\n\n### Tips on how to spot AI-generated images\n\n- For extra help, tools like AI or Not, Hive Moderation or reverse image searches can help verify whether an image is AI-generated.\n- You can also check metadata. Many AI images lack standard camera details.\n- Backgrounds and text may appear warped or nonsensical.\n- AI-generated images are often hyper-realistic but may contain subtle flaws. Look for unnatural features like distorted hands, asymmetrical faces, inconsistent lighting or overly smooth textures.\n\n### A note about stock images\n\nIt’s fine to use stock imagery when needed, but be cautious with AI-generated stock images. Some stock services clearly label AI-generated content, while others do not.\n\n### Automated AI\n\nBe aware that many tools we use in our everyday work, such as Canva and Microsoft Word, have AI baked in. Be mindful of automated AI suggestions, and remember that you are responsible for reviewing, verifying and aligning any AI-generated content with our brand and editorial standards.\n\n## How do I ensure I’m using AI properly?\n\nAll AI-generated work should be carefully reviewed by a human before it is disseminated. If you have questions about these guidelines, or whether something can or should be done with AI, contact us.\n\n## Additional resources\n\n- [UW Engineering brand and style guidelines] \n- [UW Engineering accessibility guidelines] \n- [University Advancement AI Guidelines] – UW NetID required\n- [Generative Artificial Intelligence General Use Guidelines] – UW Information Technology\n\nLast updated November 2025",

    "text": "Generative AI Policies - CSE 374\n\n---\n\nMuch of the following language was borrowed or adapted from the [2023 ITiCSE Working Group for Generative AI in Computing Education] and from other CSE course websites.\n\nWarning\n\nIf you decide to use generative AI in this course (i.e., ChatGPT, Bard, Github Copilot, etc.), make sure that it is in line within course policy. If you are unsure about what may constitute as inappropriate use of AI tools, please don’t hesitate to reach out to the course staff about the situation!\n\n### Introductory Video¶\n\nOne perspective on generative AI and education. The section on “The science of learning” (starting at 11:18) is also a good refresher on good habits and practices for learning in general.\n\n### What is Generative AI?¶\n\nGenerative AI refers to a kind of artifical intelligence software that is capable of getting information in response to prompts. The software is trained on source data, and uses that training data as input to a sophisticated model that predicts the appropriate response to the prompt. It does not understand the prompts, but it produces a convincing simulation of understanding. Examples of generative AI systems that use text include ChatGPT and Bard, and generative AI models capable of generating images include Midjourney and DALL-E.\n\n### Risks of Generative AI¶\n\n- Motivation: Some students may experience lack of motivation for tasks that generative AI can complete. It is important to understand that you need to master simple tasks (which generative AI can complete) before you can solve more complex problems (which generative AI cannot complete). Stay motivated!\n- Over-reliance: Using AI tools to do your work for you may achieve the short-term goal of assignment completion, but consistent over-reliance on AI tools may prevent you from being prepared for later examinations, subsequent coursework, or future job opportunities.\n- Learning: Generative AI can be a powerful productivity tool for users who are already familiar with the topic of the generated content because they can evaluate and revise the content as appropriate. Tasks assigned by your teachers are designed to help you learn, and relying on AI tools to complete tasks denies you the opportunity to learn, and to receive accurate feedback on your learning.\n- Quality: Content generated may be of poor quality, and generic in nature. Code may have security flaws and may contain bugs. It is important that you understand how any generated code works and you evaluate the quality of the content.\n- Accuracy: If you are using generative AI tools for learning then you should always double-check the content. For example, if you are assigned to write a program that uses a specic algorithm, AI tools may generate a solution that arrives at the correct answer but does not use the required algorithm. Further, because generative AI generates answers to your prompts, it’s possible for it to fabricate sources and provide incorrect information. If you use generative AI to assist in the creation of assessed content then you are responsible for the accuracy and correctness of the work that you submit.\n\n### Impact on Others¶\n\nThere are many consequences to inappropriate usage of AI tools. Some of these consequences may be unintended, and could potentially hard others. For example:\n\n- Institutional: Including code from AI tools that you do not understand could expose the university to loss of reputation or even financial harm through lawsuits.\n- Faculty: Violating academic integrity standards through the use of AI tools requires time and energy to detect and discourage, and is emotionally draining to teachers and administrators, to enforce these standards.\n- Other students: You could expose other students to harm by preventing their learning or including content in a group assignment that violates academic integrity.\n\n### What’s Allowed and What Isn’t¶\n\n#### Examples of Permitted Use¶\n\nDespite the risks of using AI tools, you will use them in industry after graduation at your job. Therefore, you should learn to use them appropriately so you receive the most long-term benefit. As a student, these uses are mostly centered on helping you understand course material. This includes asking generative AI to:\n\n- Generate code to complete tasks that you have already mastered from previous coursework.\n- Explain the meaning of error messages.\n- Produce an example that is similar to assignment questions.\n- Explain your program one line at a time.\n- Explain a given topic, or to provide an example of how programming constructs are used.\n\nTip\n\nAn example of a prompt that is perfectly okay to ask is “What’s the difference between a`const int*` and a`int* const`?” In this case, such an answer from the prompt allows for the student to understand a particular concept, which can help further their understanding of it in the course.\n\n#### Examples of Inappropriate Use¶\n\nThere are often times when using AI tools are not permitted. Examples of these uses are:\n\n- Writing a code solution in a language you know, and then asking an AI tool to translate that code into the language required for the assignment. In this case, part of the assignment’s value to your learning is to better understand the required language, which you would be missing out on.\n- Any use that may prevent your personal academic growth or may prevent you from understanding a topic or idea.\n- Using AI tools on official assessments where uses have been expressly forbidden, where the purpose is to determine your individual understanding of the material.\n- Asking generative AI to complete an assignment for you - an assignment that you were meant to complete - where it can generate an entire solution for you that you don’t understand.\n\nCaution\n\nViolations of this policy will be referred to the [UW Community Standards and Student Conduct] office. Students found responsible for violating this policy will, at minimum, receive no credit for the assignment on which the violation occurred (regardless of whether that assignment was later resubmitted or reattempted). Additional penalties may be imposed for repeated or egregious violations.",

    "text": "Guidance on AI use in application materials | Human Centered Design & Engineering\n\n## HCDE guidance on Generative AI assisted writing in the admissions process\n\nWhen reviewing application essays, our primary goal is to understand your personal voice and the qualities that make you unique. Beyond objective measures such as transcripts and test scores, your essay allows us to learn about your personal story, motivations, and commitment to human-centered work.\n\nWhile we value clarity and correctness, perfect grammar and polished academic style are not as important as authenticity, individuality, and originality. Generative AI tools may provide assistance, but their effectiveness depends heavily on the instructions they are given. Because the purpose of the essay is to share your voice, aspirations, and passions, AI is inherently limited in its ability to capture these personal dimensions.\n\nBy design, AI-assisted writing tends to predict what is most common, often resulting in essays that feel formulaic, generic, and impersonal. Such essays do not help your application and may, in fact, weaken it. As you prepare your application materials, please consider the following examples of how AI assistance can either hinder or support your application.\n\n## Examples of AI use that are unlikely to strengthen your application\n\n- Using AI for translation of essays, which can lead to awkward phrasing and loss of nuance.\n- Allowing AI-generated text to replace your voice and tone, making your application less meaningful.\n- Depending on AI to draft outlines or full essays, which can reduce originality and limit personal insight.\n- Copying and pasting content directly into or from an AI generator, which typically produces formulaic and impersonal responses.\n\n## Examples of AI use that can be helpful while retaining your unique voice\n\n- Using AI to gather logistical information about the application process, helping you remain organized and informed.\n- Generating questions or prompts with AI to help brainstorm topics or ideas, thereby supporting your creative process.\n- Employing AI-powered tools such as Grammarly or Microsoft Editor to check grammar, spelling, and clarity after you have written your essay.\n\nIf you are uncertain about whether your use of AI is appropriate, consider whether you would reasonably ask a human to perform the same task. For example, having a teacher review your essay for grammar or brainstorming ideas with a peer are both acceptable and constructive. However, asking someone else to draft the outline or write your essay would undermine its authenticity. The same principle applies to AI.\n\nIn short, while AI can serve as a supportive tool for editing and idea generation, relying on it to compose your essay will not produce the distinctive, personal, and authentic application materials that we seek in prospective students.\n\n---\n\n### Acknowledgement\n\nThis guidance was informed in part by resources from CalTech and “3 Reasons Why Using AI to Write Your College Essay Is a Bad Idea,” along with similar discussions and recommendations from institutions and educators on the role of generative AI in the admissions process.\n\n---",

    "text": "Task force appointed to address AI – Office of the Provost Skip to content\n\n[Provost’s blog] \n\nAcross the UW, faculty, staff and students are discovering and exploring the potential of artificial intelligence to improve lives around the world in nearly every field of study and area of research – computer science, health care, social sciences, humanities, law, public policy, and much more. AI is being leveraged countless ways, from diagnosing and delivering targeted treatment to cancer patients, to analyzing past weather patterns to predict future events.\n\nAI also has the power to enhance the effectiveness of the University’s teaching and operations by personalizing and accelerating pathways to the institution’s goals.\n\nDeveloping an institutional strategy for artificial intelligence is no longer a choice; it’s an imperative for the University. The UW has a responsibility to lead in the conversation around AI – not only in potential applications but in their ethical and equitable use. It is about catalyzing our mission to preserve, advance and disseminate knowledge and preparing students for a future where AI will be an integral part of their professional and personal lives.\n\n## Task Force on Artificial Intelligence\n\nProvost Tricia Serio and President Ana Mari Cauce have appointed a Task Force on Artificial Intelligence to address these issues and to suggest a UW-wide AI strategy. Chaired by Andreas Bohman, vice president of UW-IT and the University’s chief information officer, and Anind Dey, dean of the Information School, the task force will initially divide its work into five areas:\n\n- Administration\n- Infrastructure\n- Teaching and Learning\n- Student Services\n- Research and Knowledge Creation/Transfer\n\n### Other task force members:\n\n- Jihui Yang, vice dean, College of Engineering, and Kyocera professor, Materials Science and Engineering\n- Rickey Hall, University Diversity Officer\n- Anne-Marie Gloster, associate teaching professor, Department of Epidemiology, and member of Faculty Senate’s Council on Teaching and Learning\n- Eric Neil, chief information officer, UW Medicine\n- Andy Harris, executive vice chancellor for academic affairs, UW Tacoma\n- François Baneyx, vice provost for innovation and director of CoMotion\n- Yoshi Kohno, professor, Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering\n- Andrew Connolly, associate vice provost for data science and director of the UW eScience Institute\n- Magda Balazinska, professor, Bill & Melinda Gates chair and director of the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering\n\n### Ex-officio members:\n\n- Randy Hodgins, vice president, Office of External Affairs\n- Mary Gresch, senior vice president for University Advancement\n\nWorking groups for each area will provide awareness of current efforts across the University, identify and prioritize areas of opportunity, and suggest policy for emerging issues. Additional members will be added to each working group in the coming weeks.\n\n### Working group chairs:\n\n- Administration: Mindy Kornberg, vice president for Human Resources, and Erin Guthrie, assistant vice provost for university analytics and institutional research\n- Infrastructure: Bin Guo, associate vice president for infrastructure and chief technology officer, and Xiaosong Li, associate vice provost for research cyberinfrastructure\n- Teaching and Learning: Pen Moon, director of the Center for Teaching and Learning, and Bill Howe, associate professor, Information School\n- Student Services: Denzil Suite, vice president for Student Life, and Michaelann Jundt, senior associate dean for Undergraduate Academic Affairs\n- Research and Knowledge Creation/Transfer: Mari Ostendorf, vice provost for research, and Luke Zettlemoyer, professor, Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering",

Stating your expectations in the syllabus is important because instructor expectations may differ from course to course.\nRegardless of what your expectations regarding student use of AI-based tools are, consider including the following elements in your syllabus statement:\n* **Use**: How and how often will students be permitted to use AI-based tools in this course? What steps should students take to demonstrate or document their use of AI?\n* **Why**: Why was this policy selected for this course? What do students need to understand about the relationship between your approach to teaching/learning outcomes and the use of AI?\n* **Consequences**: How will you respond if students do not comply with these expectations?\n* **Questions**: How should a student reach out if they have questions about this policy?\n* **Privacy Reminder**: Currently, the only UW-supported generative AI tool is[Microsoft Copilot]. The UW agreement with Microsoft provides added protections, including enhanced protection of user data and privacy, for all UW users. Instructors are encouraged to explore using Copilot, rather than other non-UW-supported generative AI tools.## Sample syllabus language\n### For instructors who allow AI use with some restrictions\n*In this course, students are permitted to use AI-based tools (such as[UW&#8217;s version of Copilot]) on some assignments. The instructions for each assignment will include information about whether and how you may use AI-based tools to complete the assignment. All sources, including AI tools, must be properly cited. Use of AI in ways that are inconsistent with the parameters above will be considered academic misconduct and subject to investigation.*\n*Please note that AI results can be biased and inaccurate. It is your responsibility to ensure that the information you use from AI is accurate. Additionally, pay attention to the privacy of your data. Many AI tools will incorporate and use any content you share, so be careful not to unintentionally share copyrighted materials, original work, or personal information.*\n*Learning how to thoughtfully and strategically use AI-based tools may help you develop your skills, refine your work, and prepare you for your future career. If you have any questions about citation or about what constitutes academic integrity in this course or at the University of Washington, please feel free to contact me to discuss your concerns.*\n### For instructors who prohibit AI use\nNote: Instructors have the right to prohibit any use of AI, but because no technology currently exists that can reliably identify when a student uses AI to complete an assignment, policing student use of AI has the potential to be both time-consuming and unsuccessful.\n*All work submitted for this course must be your own. Any use of generative AI tools when working on assignments is forbidden. Use of generative AI will be considered academic misconduct and subject to investigation*\n*The assignments in this class have been designed to challenge you to develop creativity, critical-thinking, and problem-solving skills. Using AI technology will limit your capacity to develop these skills and to meet the learning goals of this course.*\n*If you have any questions about what constitutes academic integrity in this course or at the University of Washington, please feel free to contact me to discuss your concerns.*\n### For instructors who allow AI use without restriction\n*Students in this course are encouraged to explore the use of AI-based tools (such as[UW&#8217;s version of Copilot]) when completing assignments.

    "text": "Policies in CSE 415 (Winter 2025)Course PoliciesCSE 415: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence\nThe University of Washington, Seattle, Winter 2025![] |\n**Rationale:**\nEffective learning requires that each student be actively\nengaged in the subject matter and activities of the course.\nThe course is structured to foster that engagement\nin several ways, including working together as a community\non in-class activities, and appropriate challenges in assignments and the project.\n**Course Community and Participation:**\nAll the students in CSE 415, the teaching\nassistants, and the instructor form a community. As a community,\nwe can work together to help each other learn. The first\nstep in allowing this to happen is for each person to be\npresent at class meetings. Regular attendance in class is\nstrongly encouraged, and systematic absences will have a direct effect\non the class-participation part of the course grade.\n**Time Investment:**\nAs for most three-credit courses at the University of Washington, students are\nexpected to devote approximately 9 productive hours to the\ncourse per week. Actual demands will vary with the material and\nindividual student.\nEach student is required to stay up to date with assignments,\nin order for the class to work as a community.\n**Lateness:**\nStudents are allowed a grace period of two days to submit an assignment\nlate without a reduction in points. This is for each of the programming\nprojects and written-exercise assignment. After the grace period,\nit is still possible to submit work,\nhowever,\nassignments turned in after the grace period\nwill have their scores multiplied by a fraction F\nthat depends on the number L of days past the grace period.\nIf L = 0, then F = 1. If L \\> 0 but L &le;&le; 1, then F = 0.8.\nIf L \\> 1 but L &le;&le; 2, then F = 0.6.\nIf L \\> 2 but L &le;&le; 3, then F = 0.4.\nIf L \\> 3, then F = 0.0.\nWhen you submit an assignment, be particularly careful to submit the file that\nyou intend to submit, and don't fail to submit all files required in that assignment.\nForgetting to submit the right version of your file could mean a zero for the whole\nassignment. Canvas is good about letting you resubmit a better version of your work,\nprovided such resubmission is before the deadline.\n**Turn-in Deadline Extension Requests:**\nThe late-days policy and the fact that we drop the lowest 3 participation item\nscores at the end of the quarter mean that we will not\nnormally give other extensions of turn-in deadlines.\nHowever, if you are sick for multiple days or need the staff to consider extenuating circumstances\nfor a late turn in on an assignment or worksheet, post a request on ED as\na private message in the Requests topic with the relevant information. The staff may or may not\ngrant the request, especially since this quarter we are instituting the\nLate Days policy.\n**Collaboration or not:**\nAlthough the staff encourages students to form study groups, and to\nwork together on understanding concepts in the course, homework problems\nmust be done individually, without collaboration, unless collaboration\nis explicitly permitted on a particular assignment. Solutions to homework\nassignment must not be\ntaken from the web or from other students.\nTurning in the work of another as one's own is considered as a\nserious form of academic misconduct. The University has strict\nrules and penalties that apply when evidence of such misconduct\nis found.\n**ChatGPT:**\nLarge language models such as ChatGPT may only be used for general\nstudy and certain questions in assignments in which they are specifically\nmentioned, in writing, as allowed. They should not be used in programming assignments\nor the written exercises where they are not specifically requested.\n**Grading:**\nThe following is a tentative formula for weighting the various\ncourse components for computing final grades:\n* Programming Assignments: 35 percent\n* Written Assignments: 20 percent\n* Exams (Midterm, 10 percent; Final, 25 percent): 35 percent.\n* Class participation: 10 percent.\n* Quizzes: each assigned quiz counts as one participation unit.The score for each assignment, quiz, participation item, or exam will be\nposted in Canvas when it is available.\nPoints within each category (exams, etc.) will be rescaled\nat the end of the quarter in order to bring them into\nconformity with the weighting above. (The general policy on worksheets is ... no makeups for\nmissed worksheet turn-ins, but the lowest three scores of the participation items\n(worksheets and quizzes) will be dropped during the grading at the\nend of the term. Also, the deadlines during the first 2 weeks of the quarter are flexible, as\nadds and drops are going on.\n**Online Resources:**\nThis offering of CSE 415 makes use of the following online resources:\n(a) This website, hosted in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering,\nfor course information, including policies, readings, lecture slides, and assignment specifications;\n(b) Canvas, hosted by UWIT, for turning in assignment files, for hosting assignment feedback\nfrom the graders, and for access to Panopto recordings of lectures;\n(c) us.edstem.org, for online discussions;\n(d) Gradescope.com, for post-examination reporting;\n(e) Python.org, for downloading Python 3.12 (or 3.11, 3.10, 3.9, 3.8 or 3.7), which is needed in most of\nthe assignments; and\n(f) Possibly, other resources.",

Please check with your instructors for all other courses on their policies.\n\n## Using AI:\n\nContent-generating artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT can be useful in several ways. However, because it can be abused, you need to consult with your instructor before integrating such AI-generated content into your work. If you include text directly copied from AI-generated sources, use it sparingly and make sure to treat it as a direct quote with proper citation. Other uses of content-generating AI must be clearly described at the end of your assignments.\n\n### Other guidelines to keep in mind:\n\n- Do not assume content generated by AI is accurate. These tools generate content based on statistical relationships between words, rather than an underlying comprehension of the subject. This makes them prone to hallucinations (e.g., false claims, misattribution, and bias).\n- Using AI to modify content to evade plagiarism detection is unethical and violates academic integrity.\n- Any use of AI should serve only as a supplement (not replacement) to your work.\n- Do not use content-generating AI as a substitute for completing assignments yourself. It is important to understand the material and complete assignments on your own\n\nPlease see the [UW Plagiarism and Student Conduct Policy] for more.\n\n### AI Resources\n\n[AI Citation Style Guide] (Dalhousie University)\n\n[Citing ChatGPT] (Butler University)\n\n### What is AI?:\n\nIn the context of our classroom, AI (artificial intelligence) refers to programs like ChatGPT and Grammarly, which rely on computer algorithms designed to assist with language-related tasks. These AI-powered tools can help with grammar checking, style improvement, text generation, and content suggestions. They operate by analyzing text data and applying learned patterns to provide real-time feedback or text generation.\n\nPermissible Use: While resources such as ChatGPT and Grammarly can be useful in a number of ways, they are not a valid replacement for abstract or critical thinking. That is, AI tools should be used as writing aids rather than a substitute for your engagement with the writing process. To summarize:\n\n1. Not as a Substitute for Your Own Writing: Using AI to generate content that you present as your own original work is not permitted. This includes but is not limited to content generated for essays, discussion forums, quiz or exam responses, and feedback to your peers. Each of your assignments should reflect your own research, thinking, interpretation, analysis, and written evaluation.\n2. As a Proofreading or Writing Aid: AI can be used to assist in grammatical corrections (e.g., spelling mistakes, formatting references); structural suggestions (e.g., sentence length); or stylistic recommendations (e.g., passive or active voice). Programs like ChatGPT are also helpful as a conversational tool to “think through” ideas. That is, it is okay to use AI when it acts as a supplementary tool for enhancing the quality of your original work such as an editor would do by suggesting copy-edits or areas to expand on. The important thing to underscore is that it provides feedback on the writing that you have produced.\n\nExamples of permissible tools:\n\n- Google Translate: Provides translation between multiple languages, useful for initial translation tasks but not as a substitute for human translation in critical applications.\n- ProWritingAid: Offers in-depth analysis of writing by checking for grammar errors, style issues, and providing readability scores.\n- Hemingway App: Aims to improve readability by highlighting complex sentences, passive voice, and providing simpler alternatives to complex words.\n- Grammarly: Primarily focuses on grammar checking, spell checking, and stylistic suggestions. It also offers a plagiarism detection service, which is not very good.\n\nExamples of tools you should speak to the instructor about:\n\n- ChatGPT: Can help generate text based on prompts, though it's essential to note that its generated text should not be used as a substitute for original work in academic settings.\n- jenni.ai: An essay generating software and pdf reading tool.\n- Quillbot: A paraphrasing tool that helps rewrite or rephrase sentences or paragraphs.\n- Ginger Software: Offers grammar and spell check, along with a sentence rephrasing tool to find alternative ways to express oneself.",

Academic integrity is at the heart of what makes us Huskies — it’s not just a set of rules, but a way of life that we carry with us as we journey through our academic pursuits. UW students are expected to practice high standards of academic and professional integrity.\n\nIt is important to know and understand the expectations of the University and your instructors regarding academic standards. This is especially relevant to the use of technology and online resources available today.\n\n**AI content generators, such as ChatGPT, present opportunities that can contribute to your learning and academic work. However, using these technologies without your instructor’s permission may violate academic standards of the University. Under the Student Conduct Code, cheating includes the unauthorized use of assistance, including technology, in completing assignments or exams.** While some instructors may encourage you to utilize technology to enhance your learning experience, other instructors may require that you do your own work without seeking outside help.\n\nWe ask that you take these steps:\n\n- Read the syllabus for each course you take so that you understand the particular expectations of each of your instructors.\n- If you are unsure of expectations, ask for clarification before you use specific resources in completing assignments or exams.\n- Review the [Student Conduct Code] and the two companion policies, Student Governance policies [Chapter 209] and [Chapter 210]. If you have questions, please contact [Community Standards & Student Conduct].\n\nThe UW is committed to helping students realize their potential at the University and beyond.

Therefore, we are committed to promoting integrity in our teaching, learning and research endeavors.\n\nAs a member of the UW College of Engineering and in preparation for entering the engineering profession students are expected to:\n\nPromote academic integrity by:\n\n- Always observing strict standards of laboratory, fabrication and experimental safety to protect yourself and others.\n- Upholding the standards of conduct established by an instructor or outlined in a course syllabus.\n- Only using or submitting accurate and verifiable data, records or other information.\n- Always crediting the intellectual work of others by providing proper citations or acknowledgements.\n- Only submitting your own work -- neither giving nor receiving unauthorized aid on exams or assignments.\n\nAs a UW engineering student, you are expected to follow these conduct codes:\n\n- [University of Washington Student Conduct Code] \n- [Code of Ethics for Engineers] \n\n## Academic misconduct\n\nThe full Student Conduct Code is described in [Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 478-121]. The University has developed a companion policy on academic misconduct, [Student Governance Policy, Chapter 209], which explains how student academic misconduct proceedings work and a student’s rights in the process.\n\nPer the conduct code, all alleged academic misconduct by College of Engineering students must be reported to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs.\n\n### Student conduct process\n\nA brief overview of the process for reviewing reports of possible academic misconduct is outlined below. More information is available from [Community Standards & Student Conduct]:\n\n- If an administrative review is not requested the Initial Order is considered final.\n- The respondent has the option to request an [administrative review] of the decision within 21 days of service of the Initial Order.\n- At the conclusion of the fact finding process, the Conduct Officer will make a decision regarding whether there was a violation of the Student Conduct Code based on a “preponderance of evidence” standard, and if so, the Conduct Officer will also determine what [sanctions] are appropriate for the violation(s). This written decision is called an Initial Order.\n- During the fact finding process, the Conduct Officer may initiate a [full hearing] and the respondent will be notified of this decision. The respondent will then receive further information from the Hearing Officer.\n- The respondent has the opportunity to provide their account of what occurred, present relevant evidence, and provide names of witnesses for further consideration by the Conduct Officer during the fact finding process.\n- During the investigative interview, the respondent is provided with an overview of the Student Conduct Process and their [rights].\n- An [investigative interview] will be scheduled for the respondent to review the alleged violation(s) of the Student Conduct Code and the report with the Conduct Officer.\n- The report is forwarded to a Conduct Officer. A conduct proceeding will be initiated by the Conduct Officer. The fact finding process will focus on gathering all of the pertinent information necessary to determine whether or not a violation of the Student Conduct Code occurred.\n- An instructor submits information and documentation about a case of possible academic misconduct to Community Standards & Student Conduct and the COE Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs using the [online reporting tool].",

Students are more likely to cheat or plagiarize when they:\n\n- Believe that others are getting away with cheating\n- Believe that the stakes are too high to fail\n- Find no intrinsic motivation for learning\n- See grading criteria as arbitrary or don’t understand how they are being assessed\n- Don’t understand that what they are doing is cheating (e.g., they are unfamiliar with citation practices).\n\n## How to create a culture of academic integrity\n\nWhile no strategy is guaranteed to eliminate cheating completely, there are a number of ways to discourage and prevent cheating.\n\nHere are some basic steps you can take as you design your course, craft your syllabus, or think about the first day of class:\n\n- **Clearly define what constitutes cheating.** Students may not know that certain practices and forms of collaboration qualify as cheating. Be sure to [articulate your expectations regarding student use of AI-based tools] to complete assignments.\n- **Explain the importance of academic integrity** to the class, to your discipline, and to students’ learning. Help students understand the short- and long-term consequences that come with cheating, plagiarizing, or [using generative AI] as a shortcut.\n- **Replace high-stakes exams/assignments** with a series of lower-stakes assessments. Provide students opportunities to practice, learn from mistakes, and try again.\n- **Explain the relevance** of your course content. Cheating may be a sign that a student doesn’t understand the value of taking time to learn the information and skills associated with the course topic.\n- **Share your grading criteria in advance** (e.g., through a rubric) to help students understand your expectations and approach to grading.\n- **Revise assignments** to ask students to apply something specific they are learning in your class to their own experiences.\n- **Add reflective components to your assignments**. Prompt students to explain or justify their responses to exam questions. A quick scan of these reflections can indicate whether a student is thinking for themselves.\n- **Allow students to work together.** Eliminate the lure of copying, but having student collaborate to develop answers.\n\n## Questions about academic misconduct?\n\nInstructors who suspect a student has engaged in academic misconduct can find support and guidance by connecting with their campus student conduct office.\n\n- [UW Community Standards and Student Conduct faculty resources (Seattle)] \n- [Student Conduct and Academic Integrity (Tacoma)] \n- [Faculty Resources and Information – Student Affairs (Bothell)]",

Consider framing academic integrity as part of your and your students’ commitment to fairness and accountability in the course, reminding students that cheating can harm both the perpetrator and their classmates.\n\n## General guidance\n\n- You are required to include a [statement on academic integrity in your course syllabus]. Faculty are encouraged to customize this statement with details for your own classroom.\n- Review the syllabus with students at the start of the quarter and encourage them to visit the [College of Engineering's student-facing webpage on academic integrity and misconduct], which includes the College's Statement of Principles.\n- Reference the syllabus at the start and end of key assignments and exams to remind students about the expectations for them. This can be as simple as adding a question requiring students to sign an academic integrity pledge. Research recommends pledge statements that are formal and detailed and that reference consequences of violation. Sample wording for syllabus statements and pledges are provided below.\n- Provide specific examples that clearly outline academic standards in your course and clarify expectations for acceptable behavior on group work, collaboration, use of online sources and previous course materials, etc.\n- Encourage students throughout the course to contact you or TAs if they have any questions about acceptable behavior when completing any assignments or exams in your course.\n- Review [more detailed tips to prevent academic misconduct] from Community Standards and Student Conduct.\n- During departmental orientations for newly placed and admitted students, review the [College of Engineering Statement of Principles] and any departmental academic policies.\n\nIn addition to these policy-oriented factors, consider [teaching and learning factors that can affect academic integrity]. Students may be less likely to cheat when they clearly understand instructor expectations, perceive assignments/tests to be fair measures of their learning, and do not perceive themselves to be in competition with each other over grades. The College's [Office for the Advancement of Engineering Teaching & Learning]  offers consultation on this and any other engineering education topic.\n\n## Sample integrity language for the classroom\n\nThese statements are provided for instructor use. They can be copied and adapted as needed.\n\n### Syllabus language\n\n\"Engineering is a profession demanding a high level of personal honesty, integrity and responsibility. Therefore, it is essential that engineering students, in fulfillment of their academic requirements and in preparation to enter the engineering profession, adhere to the College of Engineering [Statement of Principles]. Any student in this course suspected of academic misconduct (e.g., cheating, plagiarism, or falsification) will be reported to the College of Engineering Dean’s Office and the University’s Office of Community Standards and Student Conduct to initiate the [student conduct process]. _Any student found responsible for academic misconduct may receive a zero for their grade on the impacted academic work (e.g., assignments, project, or exams), and academic consequences, with the possibility of expulsion.”_\n\n**Sample statement for last sentence \\[** **Instructor should adapt or write their own** **\\]:**\n\n“For any assignment, quiz, or exam that is suspected of academic misconduct, you will be given an “X” grade until after Prof. Y has received notification by the Dean’s office that the conduct process is complete. If a student is found responsible for academic misconduct, the student will receive a grade of zero on the assignment, quiz, or exam. If a student is found not responsible, the student will receive a grade based on the standard grading criteria for that assignment, quiz, or exam.”\n\n### Assignment/Exam pledge\n\n\"As a member of the University of Washington student body and in accordance with professional ethical standards in engineering and the College of Engineering [Statement of Principles], I will not lie, cheat, or plagiarize in any endeavor related to my academic pursuits, nor will I tolerate that behavior in others. If I should fail to comply with this statement, I understand the consequences that can follow my actions include receiving a zero for my grade on an assignment or examination and academic consequences, with the possibility of expulsion.\"\n\n## New technology issues\n\nThe University of Washington has no overarching policy on student use of generative AI. The College of Engineering, likewise, defers to the judgement of the instructor. Teaching@UW maintains a [guidance page] regarding teaching and AI.\n\nInstructors are encouraged to be _deliberate and clear_ in course guidelines when addressing use of generative AI. It may be reasonable to prohibit all use of generative AI in one course but allow specific usages in another, depending on course learning objectives. Encourage students to save records of their progress over time (e.g., intermediate products, logs of work process), especially if generative AI is fully prohibited in your course.\n\nStudents should be reminded that generative AI, like all technology, is only a tool. It may be appropriate for some tasks in some contexts and not others. An engineer uses tools responsibly and knows they are accountable for their own work output regardless of their tools.\n\n## When academic misconduct is suspected\n\n### Reporting\n\nInstructors who suspect academic misconduct are strongly encouraged to notify the student about the suspected misconduct and allow them to respond. Unless this communication reveals that no misconduct occurred, the instructor must report the matter to the COE Associate Dean for Academic Affairs using [CSSC’s online reporting tool.] After referral, a conduct officer in the COE Dean’s Office will oversee the [student conduct process] to determine if the student is responsible for academic misconduct and will contact the instructor once a decision is reached.\n\nBeyond the recommended initial communication, instructors _should not complete conduct investigations on their own._ Students have the right to due process via the centralized reporting process, which is consistent with [Washington legislative requirements].\n\nA report should be made even if a student acknowledges misconduct. This allows for central recordkeeping, appropriate sanctioning, and a developmental conversation between the student and conduct officer debriefing the incident with an eye to future ethical decision-making.\n\n[Report a case of academic misconduct] \n\n### Sanctions and grading\n\nWhen a conduct report is submitted, the student’s grade for any examination or assignment that is suspected of academic misconduct should be withheld until the conduct officer informs the instructor about the decision in the case. The instructor should tell the student that a misconduct report has been filed and that their grade is being withheld until the misconduct case has been reviewed and decided.\n\nIf the instructor has not been notified about the decision in the case by the grade submission deadline for the term, an X (leaving a grade unreported) should be turned in for the course grade until a decision is made. When a decision is made, the instructor should submit a change of grade form to finalize the student’s course grade. The student’s grade should not be impacted before a finding is reached.\n\n**Community Standards and Student Conduct provides more information on their [faculty webpage on conduct sanctions and grading].**",

[View the College of Engineering statement of principles of academic honesty, integrity, and responsibility].\n\n## HCDE grades and grievances\n\nIf you want to contest a grade, either on an assignment or for a course, HCDE faculty and instructors are willing to discuss grades. First, check the syllabus for details about a specific procedure to discuss the grade. Then, make an appointment with your instructor and be prepared to justify, with specifics, why you think a grade should be changed. If you feel uncomfortable reaching out to your instructor first, contact your [academic advisor].\n\nTo address academic complaints or issues, including, but not limited to academic policies, grading practices, fair treatment, faculty and student advising relationships, etc. Students should first attempt to address the concern with the faculty or staff member directly through an [informal process] as outlined by the College of Engineering. If a student would like support to approach the informal process, they may first reach out to the [Office of the Ombudsman] for consultation. If after discussing the concern with the faculty or staff member is not resolved, the student should contact the [HCDE Chair].\n\nFor support with interpersonal conflicts, between peers, classmates, relationships off campus, etc., UW students have several resources available to them to help resolve conflict. If students would like to meet with someone outside of the department for guidance on how to approach difficult conversations with other individuals, make an appointment with the [Office of the Ombudsman].\n\n## Plagiarism\n\nOne of the most common forms of cheating is plagiarism, using anotherʹs words or ideas without proper citation. When students plagiarize, they usually do so in one of the following six ways:\n\nBorrowing the structure of another authorʹs phrases or sentences without crediting the author from whom it came. This kind of plagiarism usually occurs out of laziness: it is easier to replicate another writerʹs style than to think about what you have read and then put it in your own words. The following example is from A Writerʹs Reference by Diana Hacker (New York, 1989, p. 171).\n\n- Acceptable paraphrase: \"When they learned of an ape's ability to use sign language, both linguists and animal behaviorists were taken by surprise.\"\n- Unacceptable borrowing of sentence structure: \"If the presence of a sign‐language‐using chimp was disturbing for scientists studying language, it was also surprising to scientists studying animal behavior.\"\n- Unacceptable borrowing of words: \"An ape who knew sign language unsettled linguists and startled animal behaviorists.\"\n- Original: \"If the existence of a signing ape was unsettling for linguists, it was also startling news for animal behaviorists.\"\n\nNote. The guidelines that define plagiarism also apply to information secured on internet websites. Internet references must specify precisely where the information was obtained and where it can be found.\n\nYou may think that citing another authorʹs work will lower your grade. In some unusual cases this may be true, if your instructor has indicated that you must write your paper without reading additional material. But in fact, as you progress in your studies, you will be expected to show that you are familiar with important work in your field and can use this work to further your own thinking. Your professors write this kind of paper all the time. The key to avoiding plagiarism is that you show clearly where your own thinking ends and someone elseʹs begins.",

    "text": "Supporting Academic Integrity | Writing @ UW\n\n## You are here\n\n# Supporting Academic Integrity\n\nInstructors can have certain expectations about students’ prior knowledge of communication methods-- expectations that may not always match reality. “Research” is one form of academic work that can be wildly different from discipline to discipline and culture to culture. Working with sources, however, is common across many, if not most, disciplines. Teaching students norms when it comes to citing sources is integral to a student’s ability to maintain academic integrity. You can support academic integrity with the following three strategies:\n\n1. Distinguish Between Summary, Paraphrase, & Direct Quotation\n2. Make Plagiarism-Proof Assignments\n3. Emphasize Ethics, Not Rules\n\n---\n\n### 1. Emphasize Ethics, Not Rules\n\nWe recommend our colleague UW English professor John Webster's [eloquent web page] about plagiarism. Here, we call attention to his central recommendation that\n\nThe first thing you can do to prevent plagiarism is to help students understand what plagiarism is: using words or ideas of others without citing sources appropriately. But we need to go further if we are to impress upon students how important this concept is to us. For the source-based nature of academic writing is one of the major differences between academic and other kinds of writing. For us, the question is not whether we will use the work of others, but how.\n\nIn any college course that assigns writing it is a virtual certainty that students will be engaging with source material in some fashion or other. To do so is to enter a scholarly conversation that is an essential step on the path to thinking like a scholar. Engaging source material appropriately, therefore, should not be treated as an afterthought (often relegated to a copy-pasted blurb on a syllabus, though [syllabus language] is important too).\n\nWe encourage you to have a discussion about academic integrity at some point in your course, perhaps when you are introducing the first assignment. This does not need to be a long discussion by any means, but should define plagiarism specifically in terms of the writing they will do in your course, and might also explain that plagiarism has disciplinary, cultural, and ethical dimensions. It is not just a list of arbitrary, universal rules.\n\nIf you are required to or are thinking of using a plagiarism detection software in your course, a section of the final guide on [For Faculty Working with TAs] discusses the pros and cons of using plagiarism detection software as a means to uphold academic integrity.\n\nBack to top\n\n---\n\n### 2. Make Plagiarism-Proof Assignments\n\nWriting is a great teaching tool because it prompts students to think critically and creatively about source material. That said, some assignments are better than others at pushing students to develop original ideas. Indeed, some assignments are so unoriginal that students can easily find whole essays online to answer the prompt (think: \"Analyze three rhetorical devices from Martin Luther King's 'I Have a Dream' speech.\").\n\nOne of the best ways, therefore, to helping students avoid plagiarism is to ask unique questions, the answers to which are not readily available. Here are some suggestions for developing assignments that encourage students to do their own thinking and writing:\n\nDesign an assignment that is explicitly grounded in the learning goals of the course. We discussed this in the guide on [Designing Successful Assignments], but it bears repeating. A meaningful assignment that has clear stakes for learning creates student investment.\n\nAsk students to respond to a source, or some combination of sources, in a way that is not likely to have been assigned anywhere else. For example, ask them to do a comparative analysis of two texts that they might choose from a list that you have curated.\n\nAsk students to compose in a mode other than a traditional academic essay. [Here is an assignment] that asks students to analyze the different types of publications on one scientific topic, using Adobe Creative Cloud Express, a platform for creating web stories.*\n\nScaffold all writing assignments. Instead of asking for a final essay due some point in the future, create stepping stones. For example: first, read and discuss the source material as a class, or in discussion sections. Next read and discuss sample arguments or theses (you can use former student writing, or published examples). Then, ask students to develop and workshop potential arguments (provide your feedback too!). And so on. If the major steps of their writing process are guided, then students will be much less likely to feel overwhelmed and turn to illicit alternatives.\n\nRemember, too, that you do not need to do all of the above on your own. We are well aware of the constraints on faculty time! If you have TAs, asking them to help develop assignments and contribute to grading is not only helpful for you, but is a great professionalizing experience for them (see more in the guide [For Faculty Working With TAs]). Also, avail yourself of services offered by the likes of the [Center for Teaching and Learning], or the [Odegaard Writing and Research Center]. These centers can help you develop meaningful assignments that encourage honest, thoughtful work.\n\n*Notice, too, that this assignment prompt fulfills several of the suggestions we made in the guide on [Designing Successful Assignments]: it explains the purpose and stakes of the assignment, tying it in to larger course goals; it offers explicit instructions about what students need to do to fulfill the assignment; and it includes a timeline of all the deadlines students need to meet to complete the assignment.\n\nBack to top\n\n---\n\n### 3. Distinguish Between Summary, Paraphrase, & Direct Quotation\n\nDistinguishing among paraphrasing, summarizing, and using direct quotations is not an easy task; some students may not be aware of the differences, while others may have a sense of them but do not yet grasp how these techniques are used according to your (or your discipline's) expectations. That is why it it so important to not only define the differences but to also explain -- better yet, provide examples of -- how source material is typically engaged in your field.\n\nFor example, in many humanities disciplines direct quotation is acceptable and even encouraged because writing style and tone are common objects of analysis -- summarizing Maya Angelou kind of defeats the point! On the other hand, in scientific research articles where economy of language is prized, summarizing is a more concise way to cite sources.\n\nWhat follows are some basic definitions of each term. We encourage you to:\n\nTalk through these definitions with your students before their first writing assignment\n\nExplain which methods of integrating source material are most common for the kinds of writing you assign\n\nOffer examples of how these are integrated successfully when writing in your discipline\n\n#### Summary:\n\nA summary is a brief overview of the main points of a particular text, such as a novel or research study. Summaries are typically significantly shorter than the original text.\n\n#### Paraphrase:\n\nA paraphrase restates a smaller chunk of text (usually a sentence or short passage) in the author’s own words, often for the purpose of clarifying the original author’s intended meaning. Paraphrases are not necessarily shorter than the original text.\n\n#### Direct quotation:\n\nA direct quotation is a copied excerpt of a text word for word. Direct quotation should always be used with quotation marks, unless there is another standard practice for formatting that is appropriate to the genre in use (such as italics or block quotes).\n\nEven experienced student writers can benefit from a quick review of what citations look like in your discipline. For example, do you require APA, MLA, Chicago-style, or something else? When quoting, what should students put after the quotation marks: footnotes? Parentheses that include the publication date? How are authors' names displayed, if at all: last name, first initial? Only the last name?\n\nShowing examples from relevant texts in your field (e.g., research articles) will give students models that they can emulate, and help them understand how and why citations are used in your field. In our experience, being as explicit as possible about these practices-- not just the how, but also the why-- will help students use them skillfully in your writing assignments.\n\nAlso, there are many excellent online resources for formatting in-text citations and references. [Perdue University's Online Writing Lab] (often just called \"OWL\") is a great reference for both MLA and APA style guides that we often share in our classes. We emphasize that being able to use a reference guide is a more important skill than memorizing conventions. While it is perfectly reasonable to coach students in citing source material accurately, we also believe that it is not worth seriously penalizing well-intentioned mistakes.\n\nBack to top\n\nNext Guide: [On Grading Writing]",

No course substitutions are permitted. Students maintaining continuous enrollment can expect to complete the certificate in one calendar year.\n### Grades and GPA\nA numerical grade of 2.7 or higher must be earned for a course to count toward certificate requirements. A cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or higher must be maintained throughout the program and to be awarded the certificate credential.\n### Timeline to completion\nModern AI Methods certificate courses are completed in succession, starting in autumn quarter and ending in summer, for a time to completion of one calendar year.\nStudents who are unable to complete the certificate in one year may resume making progress the following year. Due to the required course sequence and each course being offered only once per year, however, everyone is strongly encouraged to maintain continuous enrollment and avoid taking time off.\nStudents who must take time off (being registered for 0 credits) must maintain their status by completing the process to obtain official[on-leave status]. Not registering or going on-leave during the academic year will result in going inactive and appearing to have withdrawn from the Modern AI Methods certificate and UW. Returning to the program would require being approved for[reinstatement].\n### Academic integrity and misconduct\nUniversity of Washington students are expected to practice high standards of academic and professional honesty and integrity. Students are encouraged to understand various forms of misconduct and to actively encourage academic honesty and integrity in themselves and others.\nAccessible Accordion\n \n### Academic misconduct\nAs defined in UW’s Student Governance Policy, academic misconduct includes:\n* Cheating\n* Falsification\n* Plagiarism\n* Unauthorized collaboration\n* Engaging in prohibited behavior\n* Submitting the same work for separate courses without the permission of the instructor(s)\n* Taking deliberate action to destroy or damage another person’s academic work\n* Recording and/or disseminating instructional content without the permission of the instructor (unless approved as a disability accommodation)\nThe[Washington Administrative Code (WAC)] expands on the above terms. The most robust definitions of each term are found in the[Student Governance Policy], Chapter 209, Section 7.C.\nFaculty or instructors who suspect a student of academic misconduct file a report with the College or School offering the course, where the case is assigned to a designated Conduct Officer. This is the first step of the[Student Conduct Process]. Students who are found to have committed academic misconduct may expect to fail the exam/assignment where the misconduct occurred, in addition to[other possible sanctions] that may be imposed as a result of the conduct process.\n**[Back to top] **\n## Registration and financials\nRegistration for the upcoming quarter begins on specific days according to the UW academic calendar, which will be announced to Modern AI Methods students in advance.\n### Registration procedures\nAccessible Accordion\n \n### How to register\n1.

Click the ‘register’ button and look for the green confirmation message that indicates your registration was successful.\n#### Schedule change fees\nSchedule changes made after the start of the quarter may result in additional fees, depending on the type and timing of the change.**The best way to avoid late schedule change fees is to register before the quarter begins and to not make schedule changes after the first week.**\n* **Late registration fee**: $25 for first-time registration between the 1st and 13th day of the quarter; $75 starting on the 14th day.\n* **Schedule change fees**: $20, starting the 8th day of the quarter.\n* **Forfeiture charges (important!)**: 50% of the cost of any dropped credits, starting the 8th day of the quarter.\n### Financials and making payments\nVisit the Modern AI Methods[costs and fees page] for an overview of Modern AI Methods rates for course credits and other fees.**Payment of all quarterly fees is due on the third Friday of the quarter**!\nAccessible Accordion\n \n### How to pay\nPayment is most easily made online through the MyUW portal. Students will see two accounts: their UW tuition account (where the U-Pass is charged) and their Professional &#038; Continuing Education (PCE) account, where their course credits and all other quarterly fees are charged. Both accounts must be paid by the third Friday of the quarter.\nStudents paying through a third party should contact[PCE Registration Services] well in advance to ensure their details are on file and payment can be remitted and applied to the student’s account.\n**[Back to top] **\n## Student and campus resources\n### Student logistics\nAccessible Accordion\n \n### Libraries and study space\nThe UW Libraries System loans a lot more than books! Students may borrow from their vast collections of articles, publications, and media, with the physical Husky Card serving as the library card. The Libraries also have study spaces, one-on-one consultations with subject and “how-to” experts, and writing support (and more). The UW Libraries have a wide range of[study spaces and equipment]. Many spaces are available on a first-come basis while others may be reserved in advance.\nModern AI Methods students may also utilize other spaces on campus for studying or meetings. Spaces may range from a study carrel in a quiet corner to a tech-equipped collaboration studio.[Space Scout] displays study areas, food, and technology on campus based on building hours and includes details like lighting quality, noise level, and proximity to coffee.\n### Students with disabilities\nStudents with temporary or permanent physical, health, learning, sensory, or psychological disabilities are encouraged to connect with[Disability Resources for Students] to learn about their services and prepare for the process of requesting accommodations and/or auxiliary aids. DRS partners jointly with students and faculty in the process to establish accommodations, services, and access to academic programs.\n### Identity and privacy\nStudents may visit[Identity.UW] to set how their name appears in most UW records. This can be useful for anyone who prefers to be addressed a certain way or uses a name other than their legal name.\nA federal law called the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the privacy of student education records and dictates what information may be shared about students, and with whom. Students may[learn more about FERPA] and elect to opt out of the release of their directory information to the UW faculty/staff/student directory.\n### Religious accommodations policy\nIt is the policy of the University of Washington to reasonably accommodate students taking holidays for reasons of faith or conscience or for organized activities conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or religious organization.

The UW has a responsibility to lead in the conversation around AI –not only in potential applications but in their ethical and equitable use. To meet the challenges and opportunities that AI represents, Provost Tricia Serio and President Ana Mari Cauce appointed a[Task Force on Artificial Intelligence] to suggest a UW-wide strategy for AI earlier this year.\n## Charge to the AI Task Force\nCharged with preparing a comprehensive vision and strategy, the AI Task Force developed a range of proposals covering every aspect of university life and work with and for our local and global communities, guided by the following principles and assumptions:\n* The UW has a responsibility to lead in the conversation around AI —not only in potential applications, but in their ethical and equitable use.\n* The responsible use of AI requires a basic understanding of AI.\n* Incorporating faculty, staff, and students is important and consistent with the University of Washington’s mission to preserve, advance and disseminate knowledge and prepare students for a future where AI will be an integral part of their professional and personal lives.\nThe task force carried out its charge with five working groups:\n* Research and Knowledge Creation/Transfer\n* Student Services\n* Teaching and Learning\n* Infrastructure\n* Administration## The WAISTAR framework\nBuilding on proposals submitted by the working groups, the task force developed a framework integrating vision and strategy.The**Washington AI Initiative for Society, Teaching, and Research**(WAISTAR)focuses on key areas of Education, Research, Student Experience, and Operations, to address a wide range of ways to enable AI through training, community, infrastructure, expertise and collaborations, as well as the necessary investment and governance to create a visionary and sustainable AI strategy at the UW.WAISTAR is a framework that can acceleratetheUW’s considerable strength in AI and associated disciplines at the center of the UW’s and UW students’ futures, in service to the public good.\n## We’re in this together\nThis vision is not just an outcome of the AI Task Force; it’s a way for the entire institution to move forward into an AI-empowered future.

The speed and scale at which AI-powered tools can analyze data has already helped researchers advance human understanding in fields across the disciplinary spectrum. Generative AI tools are also supporting the processes that guide scholars’ research, writing, and creative production.\nInside the classroom, AI-based tools are providing instructors and students with new ways to critically engage concepts and build skills. As with all technologies, there are affordances and drawbacks associated with using AI. This page provides information that can help you integrate AI in your teaching in ways that are intentional, discerning, and learner-centered.\n## **What is AI?**\nBroadly speaking, AI refers to both a research field and a set of technologies that use computers and very large datasets to perform tasks, make predictions or recommendations, and solve problems that normally require human intelligence. As instructors, the type of AI that you are likely to integrate into your teaching is**generative AI**. While you don’t need to be an expert in AI to use it in your teaching, here are some foundational terms that can help you better understand the nature of AI.\nTypes of AI Accordion\n### Machine learning\nThis term refers to the practice of using algorithms and large datasets to train computers to recognize patterns and to apply what is known about those patterns to complete new tasks. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from how a generative AI tool responded when prompted to explain machine learning to a 16-year-old:\n*&#8220;Let&#8217;s say you want to create a program to recognize whether an email is spam or not. Instead of giving the computer a list of rules like &#8220;if the email contains the word &#8216;free&#8217; then it&#8217;s spam,&#8221; you feed it lots of examples of emails labeled as spam and not spam. The computer then learns by itself what characteristics tend to be associated with spam emails and what makes an email likely to be safe&#8230;.Machine learning algorithms use these examples to find patterns and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.&#8221;*(OpenAI (2024), ChatGPT (Feb 2 version) [Large language model],[Chat GPT] \n### Natural language processing (NLP)\nThis term refers to the ability of computers to analyze and generate responses in ways that mimic humans&#8217; use of language. NLP is made possible through machine learning –computers are trained on huge datasets of text through which they identify patterns in things like syntax, semantic use, and sentiment. NLP enables computers to translate, summarize, or interpret text and speech in applications such as smart assistants like Siri, search engines in web browsers like Google, and autocorrect and spellcheck features in word processing applications like Microsoft Word.\n### Generative AI\nIn simple terms, generative AI draws upon the patterns identified through machine learning processes (see above) to generate new content. Whereas machine learning focuses on analyzing huge datasets to find patterns, generative AI draws on those patterns to generate text, images, music, and even videos. Generative AI tools use math (probability) to predict what word, image, sound, etc. would most likely appear next in a sequence. The output produced by generative AI is solely based on probability, rather than understanding and knowledge.\n### Large language model (LLM)\nA large language model (LLM) is a form of generative AI that has been trained on vast amounts of texts. It can generate text-based responses that look and feel very human-like. These models use deep learning techniques, particularly neural networks with many layers, to perform tasks like text generation, translation, and summarization.\n**Please note**: Currently, the only UW-supported generative AI tool is[Microsoft Copilot]. The UW agreement with Microsoft provides added protections, including enhanced protection of user data and privacy, for all UW users. Instructors are encouraged to explore using Copilot, rather than other non-UW-supported generative AI tools.\n### What AI is not: Dispelling the myth of artificial intelligence\nBecause the responses are so quick and varied, it is easy to mistake generative AI output for actual human thought. But**generative AI’s outputs are not thoughtful and only appear to answer questions**. As AI scholar[Kate Crawford notes], &#8220;AI is neither artificial nor intelligent&#8221; –AI systems don&#8217;t actually know anything. Generative AI doesn’t think. Instead it produces outputs that conform to the patterns evident in the datasets that trained them.\nAI’s ability to identify patterns has helped researchers in many fields. But as the work of computer scientist and activist,[Timnit Gebru] and others has made clear, because it works from patterns found in their training datasets,**generative AI may reproduce the values and bias encoded in those datasets**. We need to remember this because**our students may be thinking of generative AI as a place to find “answers.” We need to prepare them to use generative AI thoughtfully.**\n## **Talking with students about AI**\nYour students are already using AI. Because no technology currently exists that can reliably identify when a student uses AI to complete an assignment, it is unlikely that you can prevent students from using AI. So adopting a policing approach to student use of AI will likely be both time-consuming and unsuccessful. Instead, because UW graduates will live and work in an AI world, it is important that we provide them with opportunities to better understand the issues associated with AI and its relationship to learning.\nThe following strategies can help instructors think about how to communicate with students about AI, set expectations, and increase students’ motivation to develop their own skills and ideas.\n* **Set expectations**&#8211; Establish a policy for your course around the use of generative AI and communicate this with students through the syllabus and/or assignment prompts. Here are some[sample syllabus statements] you can use or adapt to help articulate your expectations for student use of AI in your course.\n* **Acknowledge that struggle is part of learning**&#8211; Talk with students about how intellectual struggle is an necessary part of learning. Learning happens only when we move outside what we already know. Explain to students that when they use generative AI as a shortcut to complete an assignment, they may miss an opportunity to become more effective thinkers, writers, researchers, and creators.\n* **Communicate the importance of all college learning**&#8211; Many students focus only on learning with clear connections to their intended career track and may be more willing to use shortcuts in courses they deem irrelevant. However, most students will change careers at least once in their lifetimes. Talk with students about how the relevance of your course may only become apparent years from now. The skills they learn in your course may transfer to other careers &#8211; even careers that do not yet exist!\n* **Discuss the**[**social, ethical, and practical issues surrounding AI**] &#8211; The processes that support generative AI tools raise issues related to privacy, disinformation, environmental impact, bias, exploitation, and academic integrity, among other things. In addition, although AI-generated output appears authoritative and factual, it is frequently riddled with inaccuracy. Discussing with students the ethical and social concerns related to AI can help them see the social context of AI and can position them to make thoughtful decisions about their own use of AI-based tools.## **Teaching with AI**\nMuch of the conversation about AI has focused on teaching about and with AI so UW students graduate ready to succeed in an AI-infused workplace. This is certainly important. But as instructors we need to go beyond bolting AI onto our teaching to meet employers’ expectations –we need to**use AI in the service of learning**.\nTo that end, there are two basic pathways for integrating AI into your teaching practice –1) using AI behind-the-scenes to assist you in the design of your course and development of your course materials, and 2) using AI to enhance student learning and engagement.\n### **Using AI in the course design process**\nThe list below contains just a few of the ways you might use AI as you develop your course. Note how often the word “draft” appears in this list. It’s important to remember that generative AI is an*assistive technology*.**Because AI cannot distinguish fact from fiction, you should always refine AI-generated output**.\n* Draft[learning outcomes] \n* Draft module/unit descriptions\n* Draft slides or other teaching materials\n* Draft[discussion] prompts\n* Draft[rubrics] \n* Brainstorm[authentic assessment] ideas\n* Identify and analyze themes in[student feedback] (e.g., mid-quarter check-in survey). Note: To protect student privacy and comply with FERPA requirements, please only use UW’s version[Copilot] for this task.### **Using AI to enhance learning and engagement**\nIn some ways, generative AI’s shortcomings are its strengths in a teaching context –its penchant for inaccuracy makes it a great tool for prompting students to think critically. Instructors can also leverage AI’s generative capabilities to prompt students to analyze alternative scenarios, ask questions about information accuracy,",

    "text": "Q&amp;A: Can AI in school actually help students be more creative and self-directed? | UW News\n[Skip to main content] \n[\nUniversity of Washington\nUniversity of Washington\n] \n[\nUW News\n] \n[Education] | [Research] | [Soundbites] | [Technology] | [UW News blog] \nSeptember 25, 2023\n# Q&amp;A: Can AI in school actually help students be more creative and self-directed?\n[Stefan Milne] \nUW News\n[https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/26105333/Katie-Davis-soundbite.mp4] \nOne fear about generative artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, is that students will outsource their creative work and critical thinking to it. But[Katie Davis], a University of Washington associate professor in the Information School, is also interested in how researchers might use AI tools to make learning more creative.\nIn her book, “[Technology’s Child: Digital Media’s Role in the Ages and Stages of Growing Up],” Davis examines how technology affects kids, teens and young adults. She distills research in the area into two key qualities of technologies that support development: They should be “self-directed” (meaning the kids are in control, not the tech makers) and “community-supported” (meaning adults and peers are around to engage with the kids’ tech use).\nDavis spoke with UW News about her research and how generative AI might support learning, instead of detracting from it, provided kids can keep their agency.\n**What issues do you study around young people and technology?**\n**Katie Davis**: My research focuses on the impact of new and emerging technologies on young people&#8217;s learning, development and well-being —especially on early teens up through college-age kids. Over the years, I’ve explored a variety of topics, but I always come back to this broad question: How are the technologies around young people shaping their sense of self and how they move through the world?\n**Since ChatGPT was released under a year ago, what are you paying attention to as research develops around AI and learning?**\n**KD**: I&#8217;m fascinated by emerging research on what kids are doing with generative AI, such as ChatGPT, when they have free time and want to explore. How are they thinking and making sense of generative AI and its potential —not just for learning, but for going about their daily lives?\n**It seems like with generative AI, there’s been a lot of focus on whether kids will use it to outsource their creativity, but you&#8217;re also looking at how they can support their creativity by playing with these tools.**\n**KD**: Some of the questions I ask in my research are: When does technology support young people&#8217;s agency in their learning? When do they feel like they&#8217;re in the driver&#8217;s seat of their technology use? And when does technology do the work for them and direct them one way instead of another?\nMy hope is that kids will learn to give ChatGPT and other AI tools creative prompts and use chatbots as a source of inspiration rather than an answer bank. But teaching kids to use AI creatively and critically isn’t easy. Plus, I’m mindful that there’s an unfortunate pattern in education technology whereby innovative uses are traditionally found in more affluent, well-resourced schools. Whereas the same technologies, when they&#8217;re introduced into less well-resourced schools, are often used more for drill-type activities, or even to control kids and make sure that they’re on task.\n**Are you researching generative AI? What questions are you asking?**\n**KD**: In my lab, we want to see if generative AI can make teen social media experiences better. We’ve found that teens often go onto social media for one purpose, only to find themselves quickly sucked down a rabbit hole of unintended scrolling. After 20 or 30 minutes, they&#8217;re thinking: What have I just done with my time? It’s a very common experience in adults as well. We&#8217;re exploring whether we can use generative AI to reorient teens’ initial entry into social media experiences toward meaningfulness, toward their values or goals and away from habitual use.\nWe’re also looking at disparities in how generative AI tools are being taken up in different schools and school systems. We’re hoping to understand how young people use AI chatbots outside of school and in their daily lives, and then use those emerging mental models to shape what&#8217;s possible in schools and for learning.\n**Can you describe a way that people have been using ChatGPT without instructions that surprised you?**\n**KD**: I&#8217;m most interested in kids who try to break ChatGPT because that suggests to me that they&#8217;re using a tinkerer’s mindset, which suggests that they are in control. They’re asking: What can I do with this tool? How can I push it and stretch it?\nKids are sophisticated users of technology. And they&#8217;re not afraid to break things. I think that&#8217;s one reason they tend to learn how to use new technologies so quickly, because they don&#8217;t care if they make mistakes. That mindset provides a real opportunity that schools can take advantage of, to teach critical understandings of AI and other emerging technologies. Otherwise, I worry that the technology will start to use us and we’ll lose some of our agency. But I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s inevitable.\nFor more on Davis’s research, see[her website].\n**Are there ways to design AI tools to emphasize “self-directed” and “community-supported” experiences of the sort you recommend in your book?**\n**KD**: One example is Khan Academy, which has come out with an AI chatbot, Khanmigo. The company is framing Khanmigo as a tutor that&#8217;s not just going to give you answers, but actually ask you open-ended questions to help you come to your own answer. That’s a great vision. Now, my understanding is that it&#8217;s not quite there yet. It&#8217;s not perfect, but I think the goal is a good one.\n**It’s fascinating: Generative AI is really rattling some notions around learning through rote exercises, because it basically takes away these exercises.**\n**KD**: Even in my university teaching, I have had to think carefully about the kinds of assignments that I&#8217;m giving students. I can&#8217;t just ask them to write a paper on some topic, because, odds are, they&#8217;re going to use ChatGPT to write it. So I have to really think about what is it that I want them to know and be able to do. It&#8217;s not easy, but I love the conversations we’re having as educators. AI is bringing up all these meaty questions: How can we use AI to teach better? Are there new things that we need to teach? Are there things we don&#8217;t need to teach anymore? This upheaval is unsettling for teachers at all levels, including me. But I think it&#8217;s a good unsettling. It&#8217;s one that really forces us as educators to focus on the goals of teaching.\n**What approach have you been taking with generative AI for teaching? Have your policies changed going into this new school year?**\n**KD**: I was fortunate to not be teaching for the first two quarters when ChatGPT was introduced! So I got to watch my colleagues try things out and see what worked and what didn’t. I started teaching again in the spring and decided to lean into ChatGPT. In a course on child development and learning with technology, I asked students to use ChatGPT to help them create a lesson plan and then critique what it gave them. The students and I found that ChatGPT creates perfectly reasonable lesson plans, but they’re all a bit ‘blah.’ They’re uninspired. I wanted students to make them better, and so did they.\nThis fall, I&#8217;m teaching a course on research methods. And I want students to use ChatGPT to help them scope and develop their research projects. They’ll discover that ChatGPT may give them a good starting point, but it’s also likely to give them some bogus citations, which are completely made up. I want them to engage with these benefits and limitations head on.\n*For more information, contact*[*kdavis78@uw.edu*] *.*\n*Video updated 9/26/2023 to show Davis is an associate professor, not an assistant professor.*\n[] [] [] [] [] [] \nTag(s):[artificial intelligence] •[education] •[Information School] •[Katie Davis] \n### [UW News Blog] \nRead more from the UW News Blog\n[Blog] \n## Connect\n[] [] [] [] \n## UW Experts\n* ##### [Weather] \n* ##### [Artificial intelligence] \n* ##### [Wildfires and Smoke] \n[Full directory] \n## Search UW News\nSearch for:\n## Categories\nBrowseAdministrative affairsArts and entertainmentBuildings and groundsEducationEngineeringEnvironmentFor UW employeesHealth and medicineHonors and awardsInteractiveLearningNews releasesNews roundupsOfficial noticesPolitics and governmentPopulation HealthProfilesResearchScienceSocial scienceTechnologyUW and the communityUW NotebookUW Today blog\n## Latest news video\n* [![] [Video: Drivers struggle to multitask when using dashboard touch screens, study finds\n4 weeks ago\n] [More] \n## UW Today Newsletter\n#### Subscribe\nUW Today Daily\nUW Today Week in Review\n#### For UW employees\n[Submission guidelines] [Submission form] \n[University of Washington] [### Be boundless\n] #### Connect with us:\n&copy; 2026 University of Washington | Seattle, WA",

ChatGPT, AI and Student Learning\n# ChatGPT, AI and Student Learning\n![AI graphic] \nImage by Mike Mackenzie Marketing\n*ByJade Pearce*\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, has gained momentum in the news lately. Depending on who you askAI tools will either save humanity, or destroy itwhile many others are trying to navigate a middle ground. In November 2022AI technology reached a new frontier through the company Open AI, which launched ChatGPT. What sets this AI apart from others (such as Siri, Alexa or a Google Search) is the sophistication of the content and its interface with the end user. In its own words,[ChatGPT] is a free “state-of-the-art natural language processing model”, which is “specifically designed for conversational language and is capable of generating responses to input in a way that mimic human conversation.”\nWhile this description may seem vague at first, its capabilities are staggering. Based on a user request, ChatGPT can produce a myriad of products from creating an eloquent poem to developing a comprehensive and thoughtful lesson plan at any grade. Trained on a massive dataset of text, including books, articles, and websites,it is able to synthesize data related to the request and transform its answer into consolidated and “[complete paragraphs] ” that is user friendly. Having amassed over a million users in just the first five days of its launch, ChatGPT has become a powerhouse of sorts that is able to provide its end user highly personal answers rather than requiring them to sift through various links within a search engine. With a[click] of a button, ChatGPT seemingly is able to give you the answer you need in seconds.\n## The Benefits\nProponents of this powerful chatbot argue there are benefits through its diversity; ChatGPT can be leveraged in multiple ways and within various fields. This is no exception within academia and faculty nationwide are debating the pros and cons of this tool. Those in favor argue for ChatGPT’s extensive capabilities that range from developing bibliographies to modeling written arguments, which easily proves itself to be an invaluable[tool] within the classroom. When properly utilized, ChatGPT could become a “new baseline for student essays” and “set a new bar for creativity.” Using it as supplementary teaching aid, students have the opportunity to understand ChatGPT’s strengths and weaknesses as well as further developing their skills as writers and critical thinkers. Using the tool in this way can not only develop writing skills but can aid student learning when writing resources are unevenly distributed or scarce. Taking it one step further, utilizing this type of practice can prepare them for life outside of college where employers may request them to have a broad range of[AI-related] skills.\nFurther, and possibly the most appealing, is the amount of time saved utilizing a tool such as ChatGPT. Often students that may have multiple obligations (such as a non-traditional student) may be able to get back minutes or hours of their day and could help reduce the struggle of balancing a heavy workload. Further, for students with disabilities, utilizing a device such as ChatGPT could provide a powerful tool to enhance understanding of the assignment at hand, or develop their skills in writing where they previously were unable to do so. Additionally, resources available for these non-traditional students vary nationwide and often scarce[resources] create an environment of inequity that can put unnecessary strain on the student. ChatGPT could help equalize the playing field and thus create a more equitable environment for students within a university setting.\n## The Challenges\nDespite these “ready made promises” of ChatGPT, it has quickly raised ethical questions and concerns. Dr. Todd Faubion, Department of Global Health Undergraduate Program director and lecturer initially didn’t fully understand the power or sophistication of ChatGPT until he read a New York Times article about its pervasive use. With the discovery of a student submitting suspicious answers and confirming that cheating occurred, it made it clear that something had to be implemented to regulate ChatGPT and other AI tools within the school. Some view ChatGPT as[plague-like], where educators nationwide have yet to feel the full force of this phenomenon.\n“ChatGPT and AI software generally make it increasingly challenging to identify and reward students who truly and thoughtfully engage with course content,” replied Faubion via email when asked about the subject. He suggests this tool does a disservice in practical and conceptual ways through inadvertently adding to the already heavy workload of many faculty members (potentially leading to increased headaches, stress and burnout) to existential concerns (some of his concerns include:should faculty concern themselves with focusing on individuals who prefer using this technology versus those who submit independently authored, critically engaged work? How does assessment need to change given this new reality that isn’t going away? What is a University of Washington student who submits work authored by an AI software hoping to gain from their college education? How does one encourage information literacy in the context of AI software?)\nFaubion points to other concerns surrounding writing and critical thinking: “AI software inherently devalues writing because a machine is doing it, absolving people of the need to think critically and learn to communicate effectively.” This issue not only affects the quality of student writing, but can undermine the faculty-student trust on whether a student is producing original work or not. Taken a step farther, this can even shake the confidence in the quality of higher learning in general. What does it say to the rigor and prestige of a school if deregulated use of AI tools are utilized? University tuition is increasing every year; is a student getting the quality education they are paying for if they rely on AI? According to Faubion, trust is essential for collective growth, vulnerability and compassion; traits essential for human development. Without foundational trust, it can create a tone where instructors become suspicious of the authenticity and originality of a student’s work instead of focusing on effectively teaching their course. What’s more, even developers of ChatGPT readily mention its limitations, which is clearly stated on its website. The[program] “may occasionally generate incorrect information, may occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content and has limited knowledge of the world and events after 2021”. These limitations \"can generate responses that are inaccurate, offensive, or nonsensical.” Therefore, heavy reliance on this tool quickly becomes problematic. AI tools are just that –tools. They can only produce what is given to them, they cannot develop an original idea nor do they know all of the[answers]. Finally, not only can the information be inaccurate or reliable at times, but there is still information that it cannot access such as fire-walled or subscription services. These sources tend to be the most rigorous and robust sources and are often favored or required to cite within academic papers and exams.\nUltimately, the frequent use of AI tools is creating a messy space to navigate and leaving many members of the academic institution skeptical at best and nervous at worst.\n## What Can Faculty Do Now?\nWhile this is uncharted territory, leaders within the school are already developing ways to address ChatGPT.\nLiz Kirk, the SPH Associate Dean for Education, has developed a resource document about what ChatGPT is, which includes UW-specific resources related to the tool, suggestions of language to use to address it within faculty syllabus as well as a possible announcement that instructors can share with their students about it during the quarter and moving forward.\nAlready Faubion has held conversations with the Global Health 101 teaching team where they developed a process for discouraging the use of this software and tools for detecting its use in the classroom.\nAdditionally, the Curriculum and Education Policy Committee (CEPC) is forming a ChatGPT “workgroup” and is in the process of developing its committee members. The group’s focus will be towards understanding how students are using ChatGPT, testing tools to detect whether this tool, or other AI tools were used during a student’s study and developing school-wide policies about AI use. If you are interested in joining the workgroup, please contact Jenn Slyker at[jslyker@uw.edu].\nBelow are other resources faculty can access in order to navigate using ChatGPT and other AI tools.\nhttps://libraryhelp.sfcc.edu/Chat-GPT/faq\nhttps://libraryhelp.sfcc.edu/Chat-GPT/detectors\n## Conclusion\nDespite the heated discussions on and off campus, ChatGPT and other AI tools are not going away. Therefore, it is necessary to start these conversations as soon as possible with the focus on an intentional way of how to use AI and how to best regulate it within an academic setting. In its[own words], “it is important to use ChatGPT responsibly and to carefully review its output to ensure that it is appropriate for the intended audience.” According to Faubion, these types of conversations must be incorporated into the curriculum while simultaneously creating clear parameters for its use and policies for violation. Ultimately, the university is a bastion for learning and developing",

The speed and scale at which AI-powered tools can analyze data has already helped researchers advance human understanding in fields across the disciplinary spectrum. Generative AI tools are also supporting the processes that guide scholars’ research, writing, and creative production.\nInside the classroom, AI-based tools are providing instructors and students with new ways to critically engage concepts and build skills. As with all technologies, there are affordances and drawbacks associated with using AI. This page provides information that can help you integrate AI in your teaching in ways that are intentional, discerning, and learner-centered.\n## **What is AI?**\nBroadly speaking, AI refers to both a research field and a set of technologies that use computers and very large datasets to perform tasks, make predictions or recommendations, and solve problems that normally require human intelligence. As instructors, the type of AI that you are likely to integrate into your teaching is**generative AI**. While you don’t need to be an expert in AI to use it in your teaching, here are some foundational terms that can help you better understand the nature of AI.\nTypes of AI Accordion\n### Machine learning\nThis term refers to the practice of using algorithms and large datasets to train computers to recognize patterns and to apply what is known about those patterns to complete new tasks. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from how a generative AI tool responded when prompted to explain machine learning to a 16-year-old:\n*&#8220;Let&#8217;s say you want to create a program to recognize whether an email is spam or not. Instead of giving the computer a list of rules like &#8220;if the email contains the word &#8216;free&#8217; then it&#8217;s spam,&#8221; you feed it lots of examples of emails labeled as spam and not spam. The computer then learns by itself what characteristics tend to be associated with spam emails and what makes an email likely to be safe&#8230;.Machine learning algorithms use these examples to find patterns and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.&#8221;*(OpenAI (2024), ChatGPT (Feb 2 version) [Large language model],[Chat GPT] \n### Natural language processing (NLP)\nThis term refers to the ability of computers to analyze and generate responses in ways that mimic humans&#8217; use of language. NLP is made possible through machine learning –computers are trained on huge datasets of text through which they identify patterns in things like syntax, semantic use, and sentiment. NLP enables computers to translate, summarize, or interpret text and speech in applications such as smart assistants like Siri, search engines in web browsers like Google, and autocorrect and spellcheck features in word processing applications like Microsoft Word.\n### Generative AI\nIn simple terms, generative AI draws upon the patterns identified through machine learning processes (see above) to generate new content. Whereas machine learning focuses on analyzing huge datasets to find patterns, generative AI draws on those patterns to generate text, images, music, and even videos. Generative AI tools use math (probability) to predict what word, image, sound, etc. would most likely appear next in a sequence. The output produced by generative AI is solely based on probability, rather than understanding and knowledge.\n### Large language model (LLM)\nA large language model (LLM) is a form of generative AI that has been trained on vast amounts of texts. It can generate text-based responses that look and feel very human-like. These models use deep learning techniques, particularly neural networks with many layers, to perform tasks like text generation, translation, and summarization.\n**Please note**: Currently, the only UW-supported generative AI tool is[Microsoft Copilot]. The UW agreement with Microsoft provides added protections, including enhanced protection of user data and privacy, for all UW users. Instructors are encouraged to explore using Copilot, rather than other non-UW-supported generative AI tools.\n### What AI is not: Dispelling the myth of artificial intelligence\nBecause the responses are so quick and varied, it is easy to mistake generative AI output for actual human thought. But**generative AI’s outputs are not thoughtful and only appear to answer questions**. As AI scholar[Kate Crawford notes], &#8220;AI is neither artificial nor intelligent&#8221; –AI systems don&#8217;t actually know anything. Generative AI doesn’t think. Instead it produces outputs that conform to the patterns evident in the datasets that trained them.\nAI’s ability to identify patterns has helped researchers in many fields. But as the work of computer scientist and activist,[Timnit Gebru] and others has made clear, because it works from patterns found in their training datasets,**generative AI may reproduce the values and bias encoded in those datasets**. We need to remember this because**our students may be thinking of generative AI as a place to find “answers.” We need to prepare them to use generative AI thoughtfully.**\n## **Talking with students about AI**\nYour students are already using AI. Because no technology currently exists that can reliably identify when a student uses AI to complete an assignment, it is unlikely that you can prevent students from using AI. So adopting a policing approach to student use of AI will likely be both time-consuming and unsuccessful. Instead, because UW graduates will live and work in an AI world, it is important that we provide them with opportunities to better understand the issues associated with AI and its relationship to learning.\nThe following strategies can help instructors think about how to communicate with students about AI, set expectations, and increase students’ motivation to develop their own skills and ideas.\n* **Set expectations**&#8211; Establish a policy for your course around the use of generative AI and communicate this with students through the syllabus and/or assignment prompts. Here are some[sample syllabus statements] you can use or adapt to help articulate your expectations for student use of AI in your course.\n* **Acknowledge that struggle is part of learning**&#8211; Talk with students about how intellectual struggle is an necessary part of learning. Learning happens only when we move outside what we already know. Explain to students that when they use generative AI as a shortcut to complete an assignment, they may miss an opportunity to become more effective thinkers, writers, researchers, and creators.\n* **Communicate the importance of all college learning**&#8211; Many students focus only on learning with clear connections to their intended career track and may be more willing to use shortcuts in courses they deem irrelevant. However, most students will change careers at least once in their lifetimes. Talk with students about how the relevance of your course may only become apparent years from now. The skills they learn in your course may transfer to other careers &#8211; even careers that do not yet exist!\n* **Discuss the**[**social, ethical, and practical issues surrounding AI**] &#8211; The processes that support generative AI tools raise issues related to privacy, disinformation, environmental impact, bias, exploitation, and academic integrity, among other things. In addition, although AI-generated output appears authoritative and factual, it is frequently riddled with inaccuracy. Discussing with students the ethical and social concerns related to AI can help them see the social context of AI and can position them to make thoughtful decisions about their own use of AI-based tools.## **Teaching with AI**\nMuch of the conversation about AI has focused on teaching about and with AI so UW students graduate ready to succeed in an AI-infused workplace. This is certainly important. But as instructors we need to go beyond bolting AI onto our teaching to meet employers’ expectations –we need to**use AI in the service of learning**.\nTo that end, there are two basic pathways for integrating AI into your teaching practice –1) using AI behind-the-scenes to assist you in the design of your course and development of your course materials, and 2) using AI to enhance student learning and engagement.\n### **Using AI in the course design process**\nThe list below contains just a few of the ways you might use AI as you develop your course. Note how often the word “draft” appears in this list. It’s important to remember that generative AI is an*assistive technology*.**Because AI cannot distinguish fact from fiction, you should always refine AI-generated output**.\n* Draft[learning outcomes] \n* Draft module/unit descriptions\n* Draft slides or other teaching materials\n* Draft[discussion] prompts\n* Draft[rubrics] \n* Brainstorm[authentic assessment] ideas\n* Identify and analyze themes in[student feedback] (e.g., mid-quarter check-in survey). Note: To protect student privacy and comply with FERPA requirements, please only use UW’s version[Copilot] for this task.### **Using AI to enhance learning and engagement**\nIn some ways, generative AI’s shortcomings are its strengths in a teaching context –its penchant for inaccuracy makes it a great tool for prompting students to think critically. Instructors can also leverage AI’s generative capabilities to prompt students to analyze alternative scenarios, ask questions about information accuracy,",

    "text": "-- Effective and Responsible Use of AI in Research – UW Graduate School Skip to content\n\n[Graduate School News] \n\n## Effective and Responsible Use of AI in Research Guidance for Performing Graduate Research and in Writing Dissertations, Theses, and Manuscripts for Publications\n\n[lifted in its entirety from Georgia Tech (Georgia Institute of Technology), and revised in response to feedback from the UW Graduate School Council and key stakeholders across all three UW campuses[1],[2]]\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence has expanded greatly in recent years to all sectors of society. Generative AI and Large Language Models, like [ChatGPT] [®], [Microsoft Co] [–] [Pilot®], and [Google Gemini] [®] are rapidly becoming available, expanding access to this technology for use by anyone who is digitally literate.\n\nThese tools can be used effectively in conducting research, and this guidance document is developed to assist researchers, especially graduate students, in this purpose. The guidelines presented here are recommendations only and will evolve with the rapidly changing landscape of AI.[2]\n\nAI tools will also impact your teaching. While some of the guidance below will be relevant to your work as a scholar, please also visit this page from the Center for Teaching and Learning to [learn more about AI+Teaching] \n\nSome questions that guide the discussion are as follows:\n\n- What restrictions do professional societies and publishers place on the use of AI in publications and in reviewing papers or proposals?\n- How can students (and other researchers) transparently indicate within their written works the contribution of generative AI or other assistive technologies?\n- Are students at risk of committing research misconduct in the form of plagiarism if they use a generative AI platform to write parts of their thesis?\n- How might using AI affect the student’s development of personal knowledge and skills?\n- How can students improve their skills in using AI as a tool in research?\n- How confidential is the process? Is a student giving away valuable ideas or research results to an open platform (like ChatGPT) before the topic is peer reviewed and published? Will you lose your intellectual property rights, such as patents?\n- How accurate are the results from an AI source?\n- How can students use AI effectively as a writing or editing tool for publications and their thesis?\n- How can students use AI effectively as a tool to help generate research ideas and approaches?\n- What are potential equity impacts and implications for generative AI use? What are ways to reduce unintended impacts that may perpetuate equity gaps? What other ethical considerations should be considered about responsible AI use? [Use of AI policy] from the Spencer Foundation.\n- [MyGrad] \n\nChatGPT® was asked similar questions, and both questions and the generated responses are given in the Appendix. Note that ChatGPT® has the following disclaimer:\n\n“While we have safeguards in place, the system may occasionally generate incorrect or misleading information and produce offensive or biased content. It is not intended to give advice.”\n\n### Strengths of Large Language Models and Generative AI\n\n- It may help improve the communication skills of non-native speakers.\n- It can summarize existing information that is freely available and not behind firewalls or paywalls and is neither too old nor too recent. For example, it can summarize existing methodologies in a particular research area or positions on a topic.\n- It can sort through a large amount of information quickly to synthesize content from that information.\n\n### Challenges for AI\n\n- Confidentiality or security of data voluntarily input to a Large Language Model by users depends on the policies and practices of the company that owns that platform. For preciseness, these terms should be accessed outside of the AI platform, rather than prompt the AI platform for these terms. For your own security and confidentiality of your data, it is more prudent to assume that whatever is fed into a query is owned by that company.\n- People are prone to biases in their work, and AI can pick up those biases from the training data and even amplify them or introduce its own.\n- AI tools are better at summarizing information than retrieving it. Using these tools as search engines will likely result in biased results.\n- The quality of the output depends on the algorithmic approach, the quality of the training data, and the user’s understanding of the tools’ limitations and biases as they write queries. Though the content generated may sound very plausible, it may be inaccurate such as including non-existent publications or incorrect citations of publications. There are many companies that provide generative AI platforms, and the quality is mixed.\n- Current algorithms can summarize but do not necessarily generate accurate, unbiased, and dependable new or creative ideas.\n\n### Use of AI in Graduate Student Research\n\nCreating new knowledge and performing research is at the highest level of the educational experience of students. Novice researchers must learn essential critical thinking skills needed in formulating a research idea, determining appropriate methods and approaches for the research plan, collecting data, summarizing results, and drawing conclusions. AI can be a valuable tool for assistance but is not an accountable entity for the research outcomes since the ultimate responsibility of research lies with the human.\n\nYour program, instructor, or advisor may have provided specific expectations around the use of AI in your research. As you consider the use highlighted below, ensure that you are honoring their expectations and any agreements/attestations you have made with them. There may be serious consequences for breaking academic agreements. [UW’s Academic Misconduct Policy can be found here.] \n\n### Guidance on the Use of Generative AI in Generating Research Ideas or Approaches\n\n- Prompt engineering is important: Practice the prompts used for Generative AI. The value of the response depends on the value of the prompt. If you provide a low quality or vague prompt, you will get vague results. Critical thinking skills may be enhanced by learning how to iterate on the prompts to refine results or to use the material gathered from one result to identify new avenues of inquiry to pursue. Examples of strategies for prompt engineering are found in the [OpenAI Guide] and in [Ivan Allen article on prompt engineering] [.] \n- Surveying Existing Approaches: Large Language Models, if trained broadly in a topic, can give an initial overview of existing approaches or existing literature on a topic. Current research sources such as library or professional society databases are more reliable in terms of accuracy of peer-reviewed content. See the [Rutgers University Library site] for guidance and AI platforms for searching research databases.\n- Brainstorming: You can use the AI tool as a brainstorming partner, where you exchange ideas whether the AI prompts you or you prompt the AI for ideas. Brainstorming is an iterative process that can be made more effective with the way that the queries are posted. For more samples or information, post this query: “How can I use AI to help me to brainstorm an idea?”\n\n#### Advice on Usage\n\n- Don’t share any data or information that is confidential, proprietary, or have IP implications. Your uploaded data or ideas might be incorporated into the learning model to be available for others in your research area, prior to you having a chance to publish it. If you intend to pursue commercialization or other Intellectual Property avenues for your work, putting the information into an open AI platform may be considered as disclosure.\n- Be scientific with your prompts (or queries): Prompting is not deterministic, so the same prompt at a different time may result in a different response. Small changes in the wording of the prompt may yield very different responses. Keep records, make small changes and see how it affects the outcome, etc.\n- Be very skeptical of the results and be sure to do your due diligence in fact-checking information. Do not trust any outputs that you do not evaluate yourself or trace back to original credible sources. There are many stories of generative AI giving citations of articles that do not exist (see the article in the Chronicles of Higher Education by Hicks referenced below).\n\n### Guidance on the Use of Generative AI in Writing Publications or Theses\n\nSubstantive Generative AI assistance: Using an AI to write a portion of a dissertation or paper may constitute cheating and/or plagiarism.\n\nFrom language on Academic Misconduct from the Office of Community Standards and Student Conduct:\n\n- Artificial Intelligence (AI) content generators, such as ChatGPT, present opportunities that can contribute to your learning and academic work. However, using these technologies may also violate the academic standards of the University.\n\nFrom the Student Conduct Code 209.7.C\n\n- Academic Misconduct Includes: “Cheating,” which includes, but is not limited to: The use of unauthorized assistance in taking quizzes, tests, or examinations, or completing assignments;\n\n- Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to: a. The use, by paraphrase or direct quotation, of the published or unpublished work of another person without full and clear acknowledgment; or b. The unacknowledged use of materials prepared by another person or acquired from an entity engaging in the selling of term papers or other academic materials.\n\n- Academic Misconduct Includes: Unauthorized collaboration.\n\n- Given the mention of assistance from AI in the discussion of plagiarism section Academic Misconduct Policy, is it ever OK to use an AI source in brainstorming or otherwise to help generate research ideas?",

In the [last newsletter], we introduced many resources that can help you stay active in the colder months. Let us know if you have tried any new activities we recommended. As midterms approach, many of you have started to prepare for exams. With generative AI becoming an integral part of education, we want to review with you the strength and weakness of using AI for learning.\n\nWhen used effectively, generative AI can facilitate learning. With written assignments, these tools can check for grammatical errors and provide stylistic suggestions. Tools like [Microsoft Copilot]  can create illustrative visuals for presentations. For exams, you can generate practice questions by feeding AI the appropriate learning materials. If you are an auditory learner, Google NotebookLM can even craft a personalized podcast based on the learning material you provide.\n\nWith all the benefits of generative AI in mind, we caution you that “AI is neither artificial nor intelligent,” according to AI scholar [Kate Crawford]. It does not replace or even remotely compare to human thinking. Here are a few things to watch out for when using AI:\n\n- **Do not use AI for facts:** Generative AI uses vast amount of online data to generate _seemingly sensible_ but often incorrect responses.\n- **Do not replace literature review with AI searches:** Generative AI frequently creates citations to back up their false claims, a process we call hallucinations.\n- **Do not submit your entire manuscript to AI:** This may violate journal requirements. Anything you submit may become part of the online database which feeds into a cycle of false information.\n- **Cite your sources:** If at any point you are using AI in your work, communicate that clearly and honestly.\n\nYou can learn more about the strengths and limitations of using AI through many UW resources like the [UW AI Discussion]  and [AI+Teaching at UW]. Other guidelines that focus on [cyber security]  and [academic integrity]  in the use of AI are also available. Be sure to check them out!\n\nRemember, AI tools are powerful, but they are not the only available resource when preparing for an exam. The UW library system offers extensive services, including [research guides]  for over 50 disciplines and a tri-campus writing and research support program ( [learn more]). If you are looking for an expert in your field of study, consider making an appointment with a [subject librarian]  at the Graduate Student Research Institute who can assist you in crafting effective searches.\n\nBeyond virtual and library support, a conducive environment for learning can also improve your efficiency. Collaborative study groups are a proven way to enhance understanding, especially for challenging subjects. Here, we provide you with a few strategies to organize a productive study group:\n\n- **Choose the right environment:** Study spaces are hard to come by in popular common areas around campus, especially during exam periods. Reserve ahead a study room via the [UW libraries]. For more refined search, you can use [SCOUT]  to filter spaces by noise level.\n- **Come with a study plan: Outline a study plan before the studying session**. You can assign topics to each member and rotate teaching roles to reinforce understanding. Share resources and quiz each other on key topics.\n- **Set time limits**: time management is crucial to prevent group sessions from becoming unproductive. Break sessions into blocks and use techniques like the [Pomodoro Technique]. Allocate time for each topic you want to cover.\n- **Encourage open communication:** a supportive atmosphere helps everyone feel comfortable asking questions and sharing insights. Taking turns to ensure every member has an opportunity to contribute.\n- **Leverage technology:** use tools like Google Docs or [Notion]  for real-time collaboration on notes and study materials.\n\nEven with the proper learning tools and environment, we understand that midterm season can feel stressful. Prioritizing self-care is essential to maintaining focus and mental clarity. Check out [stress management techniques]  compiled by the Whole U for new ways to manage exam-related stress and anxiety. Finally, we want to give another shout out to [our furry friends at Paws 4 a break]  who are diligently working to provide support for our community this quarter. Go visit them at Schmitz Hall 4thfloor lobby if you want a mental break from all the studying.\n\nAs always, CIRCLE is here to advocate, engage and support you at UW. Feel free to visit us in 250 Schmitz Hall every Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. for office hours. Drop in and talk to a friend!",

And over the past two years, we have had wide ranging discussions about AI, the need for a University-wide strategy on AI and our institution’s responsibility to lead in this conversation – not only in potential applications but in the ethical and equitable use of AI in all aspects of our mission: teaching and learning, research and discovery, outreach and engagement.\n\nWith the appointment of a vice provost for AI, we will further position ourselves as a model for how universities can responsibly and creatively adapt to the age of AI in our academic mission and in administration and governance. By leading the AI@UW initiative, Professor Smith aims to accelerate innovation and collaboration, illuminate achievements, and propagate effective practices throughout the UW community and beyond.\n\nThe new vice provost for AI position also marks the sunsetting of the AI Task Force that was charged in early 2024 to suggest an institution-wide strategy for AI. I’d like to thank the task force members, as well as chairs Andreas Bohman and Anind Dey, for their multifaceted work exploring the UW’s responsibility to lead in the conversation around AI – not only in potential applications but in their ethical and equitable use. The task force’s work provides a wealth of insight and ideas to continue the conversation.\n\nAI@UW will consist of a set of efforts, including an AI governance committee, a new AI-focused website that highlights faculty and research across the University, and SEED-AI grants to fund projects that explore the use of AI, broadly construed, in UW educational activities, led by UW faculty. SEED-AI grants will support exploratory projects aiming to discover how AI can enhance learning and teaching across disciplines, create a learning community within the UW, and inspire future developments of AI for teaching and learning and AI literacy across disciplines, ensuring that our students are prepared for the workforce needs of today and tomorrow.\n\nThe vice provost position and these AI-related efforts are made possible by the generosity of donors Lisa and Charles Simonyi who recently established the Simonyi Endowed Chair for Artificial Intelligence and the Simonyi Fund for Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies.\n\n###### UW gift announcement\n\n- [Gift from Simonyis establishes AI@UW] \n\n###### News coverage\n\n- [Seattle Times] \n- [Geekwire] \n\nThe Simonyis have a long history of supporting the UW. Lisa Simonyi is the chair of the UW Foundation Board, and Charles Simonyi is a technical fellow at Microsoft, where he also was a pioneer in developing software applications.\n\nLisa Simonyi leverages her leadership and philanthropy to accelerate innovative research and education. She is a tireless advocate for educating students in AI so they are equipped to enter the workforce with the skills needed to become industry leaders and innovators.\n\nThe Simonyis also have generously supported research at the Institute for Data-intensive Research in Astrophysics and Cosmology, which uses advanced data science to explore the Universe based on imagery gained from the Simonyi Survey Telescope at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile.\n\nDriven by curiosity and a long-term hope to create useful tools, [Professor Smith] has been at the forefront of research in AI and teaching AI for more than 20 years. He is committed to promoting AI literacy, exploring how AI can enrich learning across disciplines, and helping steer AI’s development in ways that are most useful to the University’s mission.\n\nI am grateful to Professor Smith for his willingness to take on this leadership role as he guides the University in developing our University-wide strategy and approach to AI research and education, and to the Simonyis for their vision and deep commitment to the University that make this possible.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTricia R.

    "text": "Use of Generative AI in CSE 351! Skip to page content\n\n# Use of Generative AI in CSE 351\n\n## Generative AI (ChatGPT/Bard)\n\nIf you decide to use generative AI in this course (i.e., ChatGPT/Bard), make sure that it is in line within course policy. If you are unsure about what may constitute as inappropriate use of AI tools, please don't hesitate to reach out to the course staff about the situation!\n\n### Introductory Video\n\nOne perspective on generative AI and education. The section on \"The science of learning\" (starting at 11:18) is also a good refresher on good habits and practices for learning in general.\n\n---\n\n### What is Generative AI?\n\nGenerative AI refers to a kind of artifical intelligence software that is capable of getting information in response to prompts. The software is trained on source data, and uses that training data as input to a sophisticated model that predicts the appropriate response to the prompt. It does not understand the prompts, but it produces a convincing simulation of understanding. Examples of generative AI systems that use text include ChatGPT and Bard, and generative AI models capable of generating images include Midjourney and DALL-E.\n\n---\n\n### Risks of Generative AI\n\n- Motivation: Some students may experience lack of motivation for tasks that generative AI can complete. It is important to understand that you need to master simple tasks (which generative AI can complete) before you can solve more complex problems (which generative AI cannot complete). Stay motivated!\n- Over-reliance: Using AI tools to do your work for you may achieve the short-term goal of assignment completion, but consistent over-reliance on AI tools may prevent you from being prepared for later examinations, subsequent coursework, or future job opportunities.\n- Learning: Generative AI can be a powerful productivity tool for users who are already familiar with the topic of the generated content because they can evaluate and revise the content as appropriate. Tasks assigned by your teachers are designed to help you learn, and relying on AI tools to complete tasks denies you the opportunity to learn, and to receive accurate feedback on your learning.\n- Quality: Content generated may be of poor quality, and generic in nature. Code may have security flaws and may contain bugs. It is important that you understand how any generated code works and you evaluate the quality of the content.\n- Accuracy: If you are using generative AI tools for learning then you should always double-check the content. For example, if you are assigned to write a program that uses a specific algorithm, AI tools may generate a solution that arrives at the correct answer but does not use the required algorithm. If you use generative AI to assist in the creation of assessed content then you are responsible for the accuracy and correctness of the work that you submit.\n\n---\n\n### Impact on others\n\nThere are many consequences to inappropriate usage of AI tools. Some of these consequences may be unintended, and could potentially harm others. For example:\n\n- Institutional: Including code from AI tools that you do not understand could expose the university to loss of reputation or even financial harm through lawsuits.\n- Faculty: Violating academic integrity standards through the use of AI tools requires time and energy, and is emotionally draining to teachers and administrators, to enforce these standards.\n- Other students: You could expose other students to harm by preventing their learning or including content in a group assignment that violates academic integrity.\n\n## What's allowed vs. what isn't\n\n### Examples of permitted use\n\nDespite the risks of using AI tools, you will use them in industry after graduation at your job. Therefore, you should learn to use them appropriately so you receive the most long-term benefit. As a student, these uses are mostly centered on helping you understand course material. This includes asking generative AI to:\n\n- Explain the meaning of error messages.\n- Produce an example that is similar to assignment questions.\n- Explain your program one line at a time.\n- Explain a given topic, or to provide an example of how programming constructs are used.\n\nAn example of a prompt that is perfectly okay to ask is \"Why does increasing the associativity of a cache cause a decrease in conflict misses?\" In this case, such an answer from the prompt allows for the student to understand a particular concept, which can help further their understanding of it in the course.\n\n---\n\n### Examples of inappropriate use\n\nThere are often times when using AI tools are not permitted. Examples of these uses are:\n\n- Any use that may prevent your personal academic growth or may prevent you from understanding a topic or idea.\n- Writing a code solution in a language you know and then asking an AI tool to translate that code into the language required for the assignment. In this case, part of the assignment's value to your learning is to better understand the required language, which you would be missing out on.\n- Using AI tools on official assessments where uses have been expressly forbidden, such as invigilated exams where the purpose is to determine your individual understanding of the material.\n- Asking generative AI to complete an assignment for you that you were meant to complete.\n\nOn the other hand, prompts that deal with solving parts your lab/homework are not permitted. Again, please don't hesitate to visit support hours or post on the Ed discussion board if you get stuck. We want you to succeed in this course!",
