<p>Dear EICC Community,</p>
<div>You spoke and we listened. In our <i>Great Colleges to Work For</i>&nbsp;survey, one of the lowest satisfaction areas was the statement <b>&ldquo;<i>I am paid fairly for my work</i>.&rdquo;</b>&nbsp;That feedback was clear and important. It told us that we need to do better&mdash;and that fairness in compensation matters deeply to you.<br /><br /></div>
<div>Thanks to increased enrollment last fiscal year and this fall, we are in a stronger financial position, one that allows us to take meaningful steps forward. Last night, the EICC Board of Trustees approved a multi-phase compensation plan that updates our pay structure, aligns salaries with market data, and includes a pay increase effective Jan. 1, 2026.<br /><br /></div>
<div><b>A Structure Built on Fairness and Clarity<br /><br /></b></div>
<div>Over the past several years, our HR and senior leadership team partnered with Newport Group to complete a comprehensive compensation study based on data from Iowa community colleges and regional workforce benchmarks. The result is a modernized staff salary structure expanding 16 staff pay grades to 20<b>,</b>&nbsp;providing clearer alignment between roles, responsibilities, and experience.<br /><br /></div>
<div><b>What&rsquo;s Changing<br /><br /></b></div>
<div>Staff positions were assessed and placed on the new salary scales based on job descriptions, regional workforce, and state community college data. A formulaic approach was applied to ensure consistency in placement and determine appropriate compression.<br /><br /></div>
<div>The first phase of implementation takes effect Jan. 1, 2026, and focuses on ensuring our pay is fair and competitive</div>
<ul>
<li>
<div role="presentation"><b>Market alignment:</b>&nbsp;Staff whose pay currently falls below the new salary range minimum will be brought up to that minimum. Sixty-six staff will receive market alignment adjustments<b>.</b></div>
<div role="presentation"><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
</li>
<li>
<div role="presentation"><b>Compression adjustments</b>: Targeted adjustments will be made for long-serving staff whose pay has not kept pace over time, ensuring internal consistency and recognition of experience. Compression adjustments will be made for <b>116 staff.</b></div>
<div role="presentation"><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
</li>
<li><b>2% salary increase for all full-time employees and permanent part-time Staff</b>: Employees, including full-time faculty, will receive a 2% salary increase as part of our continued investment in the people who make EICC strong.<br /><br /></li>
<ul>
<li><b>The following positions are not eligible for this mid-year salary increase</b>:<br /><br /></li>
<ul>
<li>Adjunct faculty</li>
<li>CE/ABE part-time instructors/faculty</li>
<li>Work-study</li>
<li>Student wage workers</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<div>Full-time faculty will receive this <b>2% pay increase</b>&nbsp;as part of the across-the-board adjustment. However, because faculty compensation is determined through the collective bargaining process, full-time faculty positions were not part of the market study. We recognize the importance of maintaining competitive faculty pay&nbsp;and will continue to work collaboratively with the Faculty Association through the Interest-Based Bargaining (IBB) process&nbsp;to review and consider future faculty pay ranges. We recognize this is an area where we need to strengthen our competitiveness, and we will approach that work with care, transparency, and partnership.<br /><br /></div>
<div>The new staff pay scales will go into effect Jan. 1, 2026, impacting new hires and ensuring consistent placement under the updated structure moving forward.<br /><br /></div>
<div><b>What&rsquo;s Next<br /><br /></b></div>
<div>At the November Board of Trustees meeting, the Board will review and approve the individual compensation amounts for all affected employees. Once approved, individual notifications will be shared by the end of November.<br /><br /></div>
<div>We know everyone is eager to understand what this means to them. Please be patient as we finalize the details, as we want to ensure this process is handled carefully, consistently, and accurately.</div>
<div>We&rsquo;ve also established a new standardized process for how positions are evaluated for pay grade placement and how they may be considered for re-evaluation in<b> </b>the future. This ensures a consistent and transparent approach as our college and roles continue to grow and evolve.<br /><br /></div>
<div><b>Why It Matters<br /><br /></b></div>
<div>This is about more than pay. It&rsquo;s about fairness, transparency, and trust. It&rsquo;s about ensuring every employee knows their work is valued and that EICC is committed to keeping compensation competitive, consistent, and aligned with our values.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></div>
<div><b>Upcoming Renfro Roundtables<br /><br /></b></div>
<div>In the coming weeks, I&rsquo;ll be hosting a series of <b>Renfro Roundtables</b>&nbsp;where we&rsquo;ll talk openly about college finances, budgets, and how these decisions were navigated. These sessions are designed to keep our community informed and connected as we move forward together.<br /><br /></div>
<div><b>Please join the session that best fits your schedule.<br /><br /></b></div>

<div>Thank you for your dedication to our students, our communities, and to one another<b>. </b>I also want to thank the Board of Trustees for their support of this mid-year adjustment. The Board, senior leadership, and I recognize that this work is not just about salary, it&rsquo;s about investing in people, building trust, and strengthening the foundation that allows EICC to thrive.</div>
<p>With appreciation,</p>
