Financial Aid is available for those who  qualify. If financial assistance is needed, there are two types of grants that  may be awarded. The Federal Pell Grant and the Federal Supplemental Educational  Opportunity Grant (FSEOG). Grants do not have to be repaid.</p>
                                            <p><br>
  <strong><u>APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL AID</u></strong><br>
                                              Students wishing to apply for financial aid must  submit the following forms in order to determine eligibility; a student must  submit a free application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at <a href="http://www.fasfa.ed.gov">www.fasfa.ed.gov</a>. The student will receive a Student Aid Report (SAR) in approximately 4  weeks via mail. If the student wishes, the application can be sent  electronically and an Electronic Student Aid Report (ESAR) will be received at  the school in approximately 3 days. The ESAR will determine how much aid the  student is eligible for, based on the information from the SAR and program the  student is enrolled in.</p>

                                            FINANCIAL AID VERIFICATION POLICY</u></strong></p>
                                            <p>Because students  sometimes make errors on their applications, and or a student application is  selected for verification Futura Career Institute has procedures for verifying  the reported information by requesting additional information in writing from  the student. The school must notify the student within one week of requiring  any verification from the student in order to complete his/her financial aid.  The student must submit to the school within 30 days all requested  verification. </p>
                                            <p><strong><u>FRAUD POLICY</u></strong></p>
                                            <p>Individuals who  willfully submit fraudulent information and/or documentation to obtain  financial aid funds will be investigated to the fullest extent possible. All  cases of fraud and abuse will be reported to the proper authorities. </p>
                                            <p>If a financial aid  officer suspects or determines intentional misrepresentation of facts, false  statements, or alteration of documents which resulted or could result in the  awarding or disbursement of funds for which the student is not eligible, the  information shall be reported to the Director of Financial Aid for further  review and possible disciplinary action. If the Director determines or suspects  fraud, all information will be forwarded to the Dean of Students Services  Financial Aid Division, The Vice President of Student Services, The Office of  Inspector General of the Department of education, and/or the local law  enforcement agency. <br>
                                              Note: The  regulations require only that the College refer the suspected case for  investigation, not that we reach a firm conclusion about the propriety of the  conduct. <br>
                                              Some forms of financial aid fraud include, but are not  limited to the following: </p>

                                            The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)  affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. These  rights include:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                              <li>The right to inspect and  review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the Institute  receives a request for access. A student should submit to the registrar, dean,  head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, a written  request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect.  The Institute official will make arrangements  for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may  be inspected.  If the records are not  maintained by the Institute official to whom the request was submitted, that  official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request  should be addressed. </li>
                                            </ul>

                                              <li>The right to request the amendment of the student&rsquo;s  education records that the student believes is  inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student&rsquo;s privacy  rights under FERPA. A student who wishes to ask the Institute to amend a record should write  the Institute official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of  the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed. If  the Institute decides not to amend the record as requested, the Institute will  notify the student in writing of the decision and the student&rsquo;s right to a  hearing re­garding the request for amendment.   Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided  to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                              <li>The right to provide  written consent before the Institute discloses personally identifiable  information from the student's education records, except to the extent that  FERPA authorizes disclosure without con­sent.   The Institute discloses education records without a student&rsquo;s prior  written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials  with legitimate educational interests.  A  school official is a person employed by the Institute in an administrative,  supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law en­forcement  unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the Institute  has contracted as its agent to provide a service instead of using Institute  employees or officials (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a  person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official  committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance com­mittee, or assisting another  school official in performing his or her tasks.

  <strong><u>SATISFACTORY PROGRESS POLICY</u></strong><br>
  <strong><u>Standards of Academic Progress</u></strong><br>
                                            Students  are expected to meet specific standards of satisfactory academic progress while  working toward a diploma at Futura Career Institute. Students will be evaluated  for academic progress at the end of each payment period. The satisfactory  academic progress policy measures two factors: </p>
                                            <p><strong><u>1. Qualitative Measure (Cumulative GPA)</u></strong></p>
                                            <p>Students must maintain  a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or higher for all hours (or  credits) attempted to remain compliant with SAP Policy. This amounts to a &ldquo;C&rdquo;  average. The grade of &ldquo;W&rdquo; has no effect on the student&rsquo;s cumulative grade point  average. </p>
                                            <p><strong><u>2. Quantitative Measure</u></strong></p>
                                            <p><strong><u>Quantitative Measure (Credit Hour Progression)</u></strong></p>
                                            <p>In  addition to the minimum cumulative grade average listed above (Qualitative  Measure), students must also be progressing toward successful completion of the program  within a maximum time frame not to exceed 150% of the published length of the  program. The student must complete at least 67% of credit hours attempted each  payment period to remain compliant with SAP Policy. Credit hour progression  will be based on a cumulative total of attempted credits to earn. For example,  a student  enrolls for 14 credit hours the student is required to successfully complete a  minimum of 9 credit hours (14 x 67% = 9) for the term.</p>
                                            <p><strong><u>Quantitative Measure (Clock Hour Progression)</u></strong></p>
                                            <p>In addition to  the minimum cumulative grade average listed above (Qualitative Measure),  students must also be progressing toward successful completion of the program  within a maximum time frame. The maximum time frame for program completion may  not exceed 150% of the published length of the program measured in clock hours  completed. For example, if an academic program published length is 600 clock  hours the maximum time frame to complete the program is 900 clock hours. A  typical 600-hour program normally takes 30 weeks to complete. Futura Career  Institute allows a maxi­mum timeframe of 45 weeks to complete the program, and  students must complete at least 200 clock hours out of the 300 clock hours of  each payment period. </p>
                                            <p>The  maximum allowable timeframe for receiving aid is equal to 150% of the length of  the program. For example, if you are pursuing a program that requires 30  credits for graduation, you would reach the maximum timeframe at 45 credits  attempted. The student will be withdrawn once it is determined that they have  exceeded the allowable maximum time frame. <br>
                                              If you are a  transfer student, your accepted transfer coursework will be counted in the  maximum timeframe and hours that count toward the student&rsquo;s current program  will count as both attempted and completed hours. </p>
                                            <p><strong><u>SAP Terminology</u></strong></p>
                                            <p>&ldquo;Attempted&rdquo; means all  credit hours/clock hours for which a student is enrolled and has attended after  the drop/add date for class enrollment. </p>
                                            <p>Successful completion  of a course is defined as a passing grade. Grades of &ldquo;W&rdquo; (withdrawn), and &ldquo;F&rdquo;  (failing), are not considered successful completion. A grade of &ldquo;I&rdquo;  (incomplete) is not considered to be successful completion until the course has  been completed and the new grade has been officially received and recorded.</p>
                                            <p>A grade of &ldquo;W&rdquo; is  given when a student drops from a course after it begins and they have  attended. <br>
                                              An Incomplete &ldquo;I&rdquo; is a  temporary grade which may be given at the instructor&rsquo;s discretion to a student  when illness, necessary absence, or beyond the student control, that will  prevent completion of course requirements by the end of the payment period. Students  will have 30 days from the payment period end date to complete course work.  Otherwise, the grade will convert to an F.</p>
                                            <p>Pass/fail grades count  as both attempted and completed hours. </p>
                                            <p>The Institution does  not provide for proficiency credits, non-credit courses, and remedial courses,  therefore are not considered part of the student&rsquo;s satisfactory academy  progress. </p>
                                            <p><strong><u>Repeat coursework</u></strong></p>
                                            <p>Students must  successfully pass all courses to graduate from the Institution. Repeated  courses are not eligible for Federal Financial aid (Title IV). The Institute  allows a student to repeat a failed course and allow only the last grade to  count in the grade point average. A failed course is a course in which a  student received an &ldquo;F&rdquo;. The policy does not remove the previous grade, but  eliminates the effect of that grade on the cumulative GPA by removing it from  the computation. The repeated course will be included in the attempted credit  hours/clock hours in calculating maximum timeframe to complete the course.</p>
                                            <p><strong><u>Categories of Academic Progress:</u></strong></p>
                                            <ul>
                                              <li>SAP Warning - A student will be placed  on SAP Warning at the end of a term for which the satisfactory academic  progress standards outlined above have not been met. This status is only  available for students making satisfactory academic progress in the prior term.  A financial aid warning is valid for one term and allows the student to remain  eligible for Title IV (financial aid) funds for one term. If after one term the  student is again meeting satisfactory academic progress, the student will be  removed from SAP warning. </li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <ul>
                                              <li>SAP Probation - A student will be placed  on academic probation for not meeting the standards outlined above for a second  payment period. A student placed on academic probation is ineligible for Title  IV (financial aid) funds unless a successful appeal is filed with the school  director. The student appeal must include the reasons for which the student  failed to meet SAP and what has changed that will allow the student to make SAP  at the next evaluation.  If the appeal is  approved, the student will be allowed to remain on probation until the next  payment period and regain eligibility for Title IV (financial aid) funds. As a  result of a successful appeal, the student will be placed on an academic plan  designed by an instructor that must be followed. If the student is meeting the  requirements of the academic plan, the student is eligible to re­ceive Title IV  aid as long as the student continues to meet those requirements and is reviewed  according to the requirements specified in the plan. If after one term, the student  is again meeting satisfactory academic progress, the student will be removed  from SAP probation. </li>
                                            </ul>

                                              <li>Academic Suspension - A student will be  placed on suspension for not meeting the academic standards outlined above  after a term of probation and lose eligibility for Title IV (financial aid)  funds as a result.  </li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p><strong><u>Conditions for Reinstatement</u></strong><strong>          </strong></p>
                                            <p>To  be reinstated as a regular student after financial aid eligibility has been  terminated, a student must retake previously failed courses so that the  recalculated cumulated grade point average and maximum time frame levels meet  or exceed the minimum requirements. Financial aid eligibility resumes only  after student returns to satisfactory recalculated qualitative and quantitative  standards.</p>

                                              Futura Career Institute  believe attendance is vital for a student and every effort should be made to  maintain good attendance. <br>
                                              The students are  responsible for their tardiness and absences.
