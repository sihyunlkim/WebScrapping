  HIGH  SCHOOL DIPLOMAS POLICY</u></strong></p>
<p>                                            The purpose of  this policy is to establish a policy and related procedures for validating the  high school diplomas for students enrolling in FUTURA CAREER INSTITUTE. This  policy must be carefully followed by the admissions and financial aid  departments. </p>
                                            <p><strong><u>Definition of a  Diploma Mill</u></strong>: &ldquo;An  entity that: 1. Charges someone a fee and re­quires him/her to complete little  or no education or coursework to obtain a de­gree, diploma, or certificate that  may be used to represent to the general public that he has completed a program  of postsecondary education or training; and 2.   Lacks accreditation by an agency or association that is recognized as an  ac­crediting body for institutions of higher education by the Secretary  (pursuant to Part H, Subpart 2 of Title IV) or a federal agency, state  government, or other or­ganization that recognizes accrediting agencies or associations.&rdquo;</p>
                                            <p>To enroll in the Institution, a student must  have a valid high school diploma or GED. This policy must be followed when the  school has reason to believe that the copy of the high school diploma provided  by the student for admissions is invalid or was not obtained from an entity  that provides secondary school education. In those cases, the school must  evaluate the high school diploma provided prior to acceptance into the  Institution. </p>
                                            <p>The Institution maintains an &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; list  of unacceptable high schools. The list is unofficial because an official list  does not exist. This listing is maintained and updated by the Director of  Admissions. The list is updated, anytime information is obtained and verified  noting a high school should or should not be on the list of unacceptable high  schools. Moreover, the Institution is encouraged to communicate with our peers  and compare lists of valid high schools and update our list as necessary. </p>
                                            <p>Futura Career Institute by the knowledge in foreign diploma denominations  recognizes the equivalence to High School Diploma or GED as follows:</p>

                                            <strong><u>RETURN  OF TITLE IV, HEA POLICY (R2T4)</u></strong></p>
                                            <p>                                            When  you apply for financial aid, you sign a statement that you will use the funds  for educational purposes only. Therefore, if you withdraw before completing  your program, a portion of the funds you received may have to be returned.   Futura Career Institute will calculate the  amount of tuition to be returned to the Title IV, HEA Federal fund programs  according to the policies listed below. </p>
                                            <p><strong><u>RETURN TO TITLE IV FUNDS POLICY</u></strong></p>
                                            <p>This policy  applies to students who withdraw officially, unofficially or fail to return  from a leave of absence or dismissed from enrollment at Futura Career Institute.  It is separate and distinct from the FUTURA CAREER INSTITUTE&rsquo;S  refund policy. (Refer to the institutional refund  policy in our school catalog)</p>
                                            <p>The  calculated amount of the Return of Title IV, HEA (R2T4) funds that are required  for the students affected by this policy, are determined according to the  following definitions and procedures as prescribed by regulations.</p>
                                            <p>The  amount of Title IV, HEA aid earned is based on the amount of time a student  spent in academic attendance, and the total aid received; it has no  relationship to student&rsquo;s incurred institutional charges. Because these  requirements deal only with Title IV, HEA funds, the order of return of  unearned funds do not include funds from sources other than the Title IV, HEA  programs. <br>
                                              Title  IV, HEA funds are awarded to the student under the assumption that he/she will  attend school for the entire period for which the aid is awarded. When a  student withdraws, he/she may no longer be eligible for the full amount of  Title IV, HEA funds that were originally scheduled to be received. Therefore,  the amount of Federal funds earned must be determined. If the amount disbursed  is greater than the amount earned, and unearned funds must be returned. </p>
                                            <p>The  institution has 45 days from the date that the institution determines that the  student withdrew to return all unearned funds for which it is responsible. The  institution is required to notify the student if they owe a repayment via  written notice. </p>
                                            <p>The  school must advise the student or parent that they have 14 calendar days from  the date that the school sent the notification to accept a post withdraw  disbursement. If a response is not received from the student or parent within  the allowed time frame or the student declines the funds, the school will  return any earned funds that the school is holding to the Title IV, HEA  programs. </p>
                                            <p>If you have  questions about your Title IV program funds, you can call the Federal Student  Aid Information Center at 1-800-4-FEDAID (1-800-433-3243). TTY users may call  1-800-730-8913.
