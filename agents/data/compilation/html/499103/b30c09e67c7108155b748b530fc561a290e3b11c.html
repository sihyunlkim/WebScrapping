The selection for the top student is based on the performance in the classroom and the clinical training, participation and leadership during class discussions, attendance, dedication in the pursuit of this new career, and recommendations of teachers and director of nursing. To encourage continuous competition and maximum participation, we award scholarships at the end of each term, so as many as four different students may claim this award during the course of a year, or on occasion one person may become a multiple winner.</p>

Debbie continues to strive to reach her highest potential in theory. She consistently has scored the highest grade in the class for Terms 1 through 3. This reflects the fact that she has been focused in achieving the goal of reaching the highest GPA in the class for every subject.</p>
        <p align="center" style="color: #000080; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-align: left; font-style: italic;">Debbie also continues to show a true desire to learn and understand the subjects within the LVN Program. She is inquisitive and frequently approaches me after class to ask questions on areas that she does not understand. Other ways that she is proactive in enhancing her learning is the fact that she utilizes other resources, such as ATI books and Saunder's review book. </p>
                  <p align="justify" style="color: #000080; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">I feel Debbie continues to grow as a student and her knowledge is building in patient care. I hope that she will be considered for the scholarship that Homestead Schools is offering.</p>

I have been his instructor part-time for Term 1 of the LVN program. From the very beginning when I met Eduardo in Medical Terminology, he has proven to be a good student. His back ground in Medical Assisting has helped him to understand basic nursing concepts very well. His desire to further his education to obtain a license as LVN is commendable. He has set definite goals for himself to not only complete the LVN program, but to do so with the highest grade point average in his class. He has been able to achieve this in Term 1.</p>
                  
                  <p align="justify" style="color: #000080; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">Eduardo has also shown to be a good leader, having held the position of class president for Term 1. He is also open and willing to extend a helping hand to his peers with studying, giving them advice on achieving good study habits. I find Eduardo to be a very good student. He is always prepared for class and is an active participant in class discussions. I look forward to seeing Eduardo continue to grow not only in the theory setting, but applying what he is learning in class at a clinical setting.</p>
                  
                  <p align="justify" style="color: #000080; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">I hope that he will be considered for the academic scholarship at Homestead Schools, so that some of the stress brought on by financial burdens will ease and that he can continue to focus on his goal to complete the LVN program.</p>

Ariane is my student in Batch 17 and she has consistently strived to improve her study habits and bring up her grades. I see a progressive rise in her grades and she was able to attain an overall GPA of 88.75 for Term 1.</p>
        <p align="justify" style="color: #000080; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">Ariane is also very considerate and helpful to her classmates and is very kind. She is quiet and not one to fill the air with mindless chatter but speaks up when there is a need. She continues to be cooperative and gets along well with her classmates.

Edith is an immigrant but her perseverance and determination, especially  in her studies, have proven to be successful. She doesn't understand the lecture material or when there is something that needs to be clarified her. She might seem aggressive at times, but overall  she is a good student.

Kristie is a cheerful and very enthusiastic individual. She definitely exudes a strong desire to learn and obtain as much information as possible while in the LVN program. Her GPA has progressively improved and has ranked third at the end of Term 3. The positive thing about Kirstie is that she has the ability to realize and accept when she has difficulty in a subject. She is very proactive and seeks help before she finds herself in a position of remediation. I have frequently witnessed her utilizing the tutors at Homestead to help her in areas that she has difficulty with. She is not satisfied until she understands.</p>
                   
                   <p align="justify" style="color: #000080; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">Kristie is also a very positive person. She is cheerful and always eager to compliment her classmates when they have achieved a good grade. She is like a cheerleader of the class, showing how she is genuinely happy for someone else s achievements and encouraging them to continue to do well. She is a pleasure to have in class.</p>

MaryAnn has been progressively improving academically in theory class. Her last GPA for Term 3 was 85.12% placing her second in standing. It appears that she has developed a study habit that is working quite well for her. She is diligent and works hard academically. She is always on time to class, attentive and ready to learn when she attends theory. She gets along well with her classmates and is helpful to her peers. She also frequently asks for clarification from me when she does not understand a subject. This communication occurs both in and outside of class.</p>

I highly recommend MaryAnn for the scholarship offered by the school to encourage her to continue on with her efforts to reach high standards academically.</p>

She excels in her theory grades, very punctual without any absence or a fraction of tardiness in our theory class, very polite to her teachers and schoolmates, and above all very diligent, dedicated, and honest in her student work. I am certain that she is a good student and will always be for the rest of the school year and hopefully will become a good example and a good product of our schools when she graduates.</p>

The rationale behind this is to psychologically set myself up for success because failure is simply not an option for me. I take my career and my future very seriously and that is evident by my number 1 rank for term 1. My drive and ambition will guarantee my graduation in my eyes. The scholarship is my trophy; it is a welcome reminder of the hard work and dedication that I have invested in my future.</p>
