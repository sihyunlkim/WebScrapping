      <h1>Academic integrity</h1>
      <p>The academic community is built upon trust, and the consequences for 
        violations of this trust can be very severe. Most of instructors and 
        administrators with whom you might have to deal if you are suspected
        of such violations will not accept ignorance as an excuse for that
        behavior.</p>
      <p>As such, it is much safer for you to avoid trouble than it is to try
        to extricate yourself from trouble once you're in it. And to do that,
        it is vitally important for you to understand both what is considered 
        acceptable behavior and what is at stake <strong>before</strong> you 
        find yourself in trouble. That is the purpose of the material on this 
        page.</p>
      <p>Before exploring further on this page, if you have not already done 
        so, you should ensure that you have thoroughly reviewed your 
        <i><a href="https://catalog.unh.edu/srrr/">Student Rights, Rules,
        and Reponsibilities</a></i> handbook as published by UNH, paying
        particular attention to the subsection on Academic Honesty found
        within the section on Academic Policies. A basic understanding
        of that material will be assumed by most of the professors and 
        administrators with whom you interact in your time at UNH.

                  <p class="card-text">This document represents a Code of Conduct that I have historically
                    used in my courses. It is not universally applicable to all courses, and I often need
                    to customize and fine-tune it in the context of individual courses. However, it provides
                    you with a solid starting point for all of your courses in that if you abide by its
                    guidance you should avoid most of the problematic scenarios you might otherwise encounter.
                    Be sure, however, that you are aware of any additional concerns that might have been 
                    presented by the professor teaching each of your courses, as their policies will
                    always override these.

                    Understanding AI-Assisted Development (First Hour)</h5>

                  <p class="card-text">(OPTIONAL) This YouTube video is the first hour of lectures from a 
                    non-credit course offered by Tony Alicea, and it provides an excellent overview of what 
                    a Large Language Model (LLM) is and how it works. Although the use of LLMs is not always a 
                    violation of academic integrity (the rules vary from course to course and instructor to 
                    instructor), this seemed like an appropriate place to include this information. Regardless of
                    how you are using an LLM, it is extremely important to know exactly what you can (and
                    cannot) expect from it, and this video does an admirable job of explaining that.
