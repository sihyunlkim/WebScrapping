    <div class="report-description"><p>The Spring 2016 Campus Climate Survey provides data that will be enriched through further discussion. In this report, the terms “religious identity” and “religious identification” are intended as broadly construed, to include today’s diverse human experience of religious and spiritual affiliation and practice, including nonreligious and secular approaches as well as individual experience that does not readily fit within traditional lines of definition. The findings from this survey compel us to contend with complex national and institutional issues. The University of Chicago has a foundational commitment to the idea that a culture of free and open inquiry requires empowering individuals of all backgrounds, experiences, identities, and perspectives to challenge conventional thinking in pursuit of original ideas. Such goals can only fully be realized within a climate that is inclusive.</p>

Administering the Climate Survey is intended to be a crucial step towards improving our campus climate. The survey will serve as one baseline against which to measure improvement; be a catalyst for communication and discussion; and contribute to thinking about the implementation of new programs, policies, and activities that will foster an inclusive climate.</p>

    <div class="report-published-date">Originally published: August 2016</div>
    <div class="report-description"><p>In 2013, Provost Thomas Rosenbaum appointed the Provost’s Oversight Committee on Online Learning (POCOL) and charged them with: (1) overseeing the University’s first forays into online learning over a two year period; and (2) based on knowledge gained during this period, making recommendations for the University’s future utilization of, and participation in, online learning. To fulfill its charge, the committee oversaw the production of five Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) by faculty members in Booth, PSD, BSD, SSD, and Law. These experimental, non-credit courses were hosted on the Coursera and edX platforms. The Committee delivered its report in 2015 to Provost Eric D. Isaacs and made two major recommendations for the University of Chicago’s ongoing role in online learning: Develop a centralized resource on campus to facilitate and advance innovative and effective pedagogy and appoint an editorial board to review and approve online University-branded courses not otherwise vetted by a degree-granting entity.</p>
<p>The report does not address for-credit coursework. That question is more complex and was outside of the charge given to this committee.</p>

    <div class="report-description"><p>This document reports on the working environments (climate) of the Natural Science departments in the University of Chicago and Northwestern University.&nbsp;It created from the lengthy (over 100 page) report of the research findings from in-depth interviews with 112 faculty members conducted by NORC on behalf of Northwestern University and The University of Chicago.

The committee was established in the aftermath of demonstrations at the Center for Care and Discovery that led to arrests and disciplinary actions against demonstrators and allegations of misconduct against the University of Chicago Police Department. The events surrounding those demonstrations were addressed by a separate investigation and report, and those specific events are not the subject of this Committee’s work.

    <div class="report-description"><p>Convened in 2000 by then-Provost Geoffrey Stone, the Arts Study Group spent a year evaluating arts offerings on campus to determine the University’s existing capacities and ongoing needs. The outcome of these deliberations was the 2001 Future of the Arts report, which called for a stronger embrace of practicing faculty artists, more arts leadership, and a new performing arts center. The recommendations in this report marked the beginning of the University’s push to reimagine the arts in the 21st century, and led directly to the creation of some of the most successful arts initiatives to date—including the Logan Center.&nbsp;</p>
