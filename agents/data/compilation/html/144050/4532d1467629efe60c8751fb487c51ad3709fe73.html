  Academic Integrity &amp; Student Conduct

  <p>All members of the University of Chicago belong to a tradition dedicated to the pursuit and cultivation of learning. A few simple principles—academic integrity, mutual respect and civility, personal responsibility—lie at the heart of our intellectual community. Each of us—students, faculty and staff—is pledged to live up to these standards and to support each others’ efforts in this regard. We take these values seriously and the <a href="https://college.uchicago.edu/about/college-staff-directory?office=Office%20of%20College%20Community%20Standards">Office of College Community Standards</a> is committed to helping first year students in particular, our newest community members, to understand how academic honesty, mutual respect and personal responsibility enable the ongoing success of our educational mission.</p>
<p>Each new student is given a copy of the University of Chicago's <a href="https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/student-life-conduct/university-disciplinary-systems/area-disciplinary-systems/"><em><u>Student Manual of University Policies &amp; Regulations</u></em></a>. Please set aside time to read the policies on academic integrity and student conduct carefully. Do not assume that you necessarily understand what constitutes good practices for academic integrity or civic behavior: university standards are frequently different from high school. If in doubt, check with your instructors or your Adviser in the College.</p>
<p>Any change to a student status will be communicated (if permissible) to relevant family contact.</p>

  <p>Conduct by students in the College involving possible violation of University policies and regulations and other breaches of standards of behavior expected of University students—whether the student(s) are involved individually or as part of a group, and with the exception of unlawful harassment, discrimination, retaliation, or sexual misconduct—should be brought promptly to the attention of the Dean of Students in the College, for investigation and/or adjudication through the Office of College Community Standards.</p>
<p>Such violation and breaches of standards include but are not limited to: plagiarism, cheating on examinations, falsifications of documents or records, theft, vandalism, violation of computing policies, violation of the alcohol and other drug policy, physical or verbal abuse that threatens or endangers the health or safety of others, violation of an administrative department's regulations, failure to comply with directives of University officials including the University Police, and violation of the terms of imposed disciplinary sanctions.</p>
<p>Conduct involving violation of the <a href="https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/university-policies/university-of-chicago-policy-on-harassment-discrimination-and-sexual-miscon/"><em><u>Policy on Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct</u></em></a> should be brought promptly to the attention of the Title IX Coordinator for the University and/or the Associate Dean of Students in the University for Disciplinary Affairs in Campus and Student Life. Disruptive conduct involving violation of the University’s <a href="https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/student-life-conduct/protests-and-demonstrations-policy/"><em><u>Protests &amp; Demonstrations Policy</u></em></a> should be brought to the attention of the Associate Dean of Students in the University for Disciplinary Affairs in Campus and Student Life.</p>

  <p>Students must have a thorough understanding of—and abide by—the University’s standards for academic integrity. Presenting another’s words or ideas as your own (intentionally or unintentionally) is plagiarism and constitutes a serious offense.</p>
<p>One way to think about your studies is as a long, sustained conversation with your contemporaries, your teachers and peers, and thinkers, writers and scientists who have gone before you. In order to make your part in this conversation clear, you must cite those whose work, contemporary or historic, has influenced your project. This does not necessarily detract from the individuality of your work, but it does locate you in a larger, ongoing intellectual context. For example, if your thoughts on Plato have been influenced by a class lecture or discussion, you should cite it. Similarly, you should provide citations for writings you may have come across online if they have had a role to play in your analysis of a particular topic.</p>
<p>Students who are confused or unsure about the proper use and acknowledgment of sources for specific assignments should consult with their instructors before submitting an assignment.</p>
<p>Conduct involving possible violation of the University’s standards for academic integrity may require the Dean of Students in the College to convene the College Area Disciplinary Committee. For more information on this system, please see the <a href="https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/student-life-conduct/university-disciplinary-systems/area-disciplinary-systems/"><em><u>Student Manual of University Policies &amp; Regulations</u></em> </a>(“Area Disciplinary Systems”).</p>

  <p>All students in the College are expected to adhere to the University’s expectations of good citizenship. This includes, but is not limited to, honoring University policies and regulations on sexual misconduct, use of technology, safety and use of facilities, disruptive conduct, and the use of alcohol and other drugs.</p>
<p>Conduct involving possible violation of University policies and regulations and other breaches of standards of behavior expected of University students may require the Dean of Students in the College to convene the College Area Disciplinary Committee, or to refer the matter (as appropriate) to either the University-wide Disciplinary System or the Disciplinary System for Disruptive Conduct. For more information on these systems, please see the <a href="https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/student-life-conduct/university-disciplinary-systems/area-disciplinary-systems/"><em><u>Student Manual of University Policies &amp; Regulations</u></em></a> (“Area Disciplinary Systems”).</p>

  <p>Students who engage in academic misconduct or otherwise violate the standards of the University community may be brought before the College’s Area Disciplinary Committee, or referred (as appropriate) to either the University-wide Disciplinary System or the Disciplinary System for Disruptive Conduct. For more information on these systems, please see the <a href="https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/student-life-conduct/university-disciplinary-systems/area-disciplinary-systems/"><em><u>Student Manual of University Policies &amp; Regulations</u></em></a> (“Area Disciplinary Systems”).</p>
<p>If students are found responsible for misconduct, disciplinary committees have the right to impose sanctions ranging from warning, probation, suspension, or expulsion. For more information, see “Sanctions for Misconduct” in the <a href="https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/student-life-conduct/university-disciplinary-systems/area-disciplinary-systems/"><em><u>Student Manual of University Policies &amp; Regulations</u></em></a>.</p>
