  <p>The July 2025 report of the <a href="https://provost.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/2025-08/AIEducationWGReport.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>AI and Education Working Group</u></a>, convened by President Alivisatos and Provost Baicker, recommends that “members of academic units gather to develop guidelines and policies about AI” related to teaching and learning. The report also emphasizes that a thoughtful pedagogical approach to the AI landscape is one that engages the broader University community in deliberation and idea sharing. In support of this effort,<strong> </strong>the CCTL welcomes departments, programs, schools and divisions, Core sequences, and other academic units to share the unit-level policies and guidance produced by these efforts, with the aim of facilitating learning and the exchange of practices across campus.&nbsp;</p>

  <h2><em>Teaching in the AI Landscape</em> Canvas Course</h2>
<p>This open-enrollment Canvas site is the product of an ongoing collaboration across <a href="https://academictech.uchicago.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Academic Technology Solutions</u></a>  (ATS), the <a href="https://teaching.uchicago.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Chicago Center for Teaching and Learning</u></a>  (CCTL), and the  <a href="https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Library</u></a>  to provide, in one place, a set of ideas and resources to support faculty and instructors in thinking through the teaching and learning implications of artificial intelligence. These offices host the annual program on <a href="https://teaching.uchicago.edu/programs/teaching-generative-ai-landscape" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em><u>Teaching in the AI Landscape</u></em></a>, and the aim of the Canvas site is to provide a concise, asynchronous overview of the key information and ideas presented at that event.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Pedagogical Challenges and Opportunities in the Wake of AI</h2>
<p>What are the pedagogical implications of the ready availability of AI tools? In this session, we will take up the considerations that shape how we might approach this in our teaching, opening up a discussion of a range of possible responses. The session will focus on the questions, concerns, and current strategies of those in attendance. </p>
<h2>Crafting and Communicating Course AI Policies</h2>
<p>What kind of policy on AI usage will help to support student learning in a particular course? How can we communicate those expectations clearly and transparently to students? This session will take up these and related issues, and will invite those in attendance to share and discuss their current or proposed course AI policy. </p>
