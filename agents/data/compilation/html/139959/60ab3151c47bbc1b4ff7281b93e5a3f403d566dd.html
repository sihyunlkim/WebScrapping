                <div property="schema:text" class="body cmp-paragraph"><p><span>At the January 17, 2024 meeting of Graduate Council, the following policy was approved:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Per the Graduate Bulletin, the master’s thesis demonstrates independent judgment in developing a problem from primary sources, and a dissertation represents originality in research, independent thinking, scholarly ability, and technical mastery of a field of study. It is the responsibility of the advisory committee to review and evaluate the thesis or dissertation as a representation of a student’s individual effort.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>As such, the use of generative AI in theses and dissertations is considered unauthorized assistance per the Academic Code of Honesty and is prohibited unless specifically authorized by members of the advisory committee for use within the approved scope. If approved by the advisory committee, the extent of generative AI usage should be disclosed in a statement within the thesis or dissertation.</strong></span></p>

<p><span>Guidance from Academic Honesty:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/Prohibited_Conduct/"><span>honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/Prohibited_Conduct/</span></a></p>
<p><span>Giving or receiving help for assignments without prior approval from your instructor. During any assignment, any help (such as books, notes, calculators, technology, internet resources, or conversations with others) is considered unauthorized unless the instructor explicitly allows it. Examples include, but are not limited to:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Copying, or allowing others to copy, answers to an assignment.</span></li>
<li><span>Sending, receiving, posting, uploading, downloading, or accessing relevant exam information, prior to, during, or after the exam itself (including written or orally, or use of sign, electronic device, or digital resource information).</span></li>
<li><span>Completing someone else’s assignment or allowing them to complete yours.</span></li>
<li><span>Collaborating on any assignment that is an individual assignment.</span></li>
<li><span>Submitting group work that does not represent work from all members of the group. Every student whose name is on a group project is responsible for the academic honesty of the group assignment.</span></li>
<li><span>Using any cellular device, electronic device, digital device, or programmable calculator without permission during an exam or closed assignment.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>The bottom line:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>If you are requesting, sharing, or receiving any assignment or test information and it is an individual assignment, you are putting yourself at risk.</span></li>
<li><span>The whole group is responsible for the integrity of group work.</span></li>
<li><span>Don’t access any electronic devices or notes for any reason unless your instructor explicitly says it’s allowed during an exam.</span></li>
<li><span>Never use Artificial Intelligence on an assignment unless it is explicitly authorized by your instructor&nbsp;</span><em><span>before</span></em><span>&nbsp;the assignment is turned in.</span></li>
