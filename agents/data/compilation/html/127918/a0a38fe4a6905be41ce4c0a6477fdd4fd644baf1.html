<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Consistent with the Regis University Mission and Jesuit principles, each College within Regis University expects its students and faculty to conduct themselves and maintain relationships in a manner that is characterized by honesty, integrity, authenticity, and dignity as well as mutual respect for the contributions of all the members of the Regis community.</p>
<p>At Regis University, academic integrity is viewed and treated as an academic matter rather than an issue of student conduct. Each student acknowledges that the work represented in all assignments, assessments, and examinations is their own or is properly cited, and that they have neither given nor received unauthorized information. Furthermore, each current or former student agrees not to divulge the contents of any assignment, assessment, or examination to another student, or alter or impede the work or progress of another student. </p>
<p>To establish and foster an environment where incidents of misconduct are socially unacceptable, all students are expected to adhere to the Regis University Academic Integrity Policy. This Academic Integrity Policy is intended to support the shared responsibility of faculty and students in maintaining an academic environment in which the values of truth and justice prevail in all activities related to learning, teaching, research, scholarship, and practice. </p>
<p>The Academic Integrity Policy applies to any work performed by any current or former Regis University student, regardless of the student's home college or program. All Regis University students and faculty will abide by the Academic Integrity Policy regardless of the program or College where the student is enrolled. All Colleges at the University will use and enforce this policy. </p>
<p>Students at Regis University are committed to the highest standards of academic integrity and assume full responsibility for maintaining those standards. All Regis University members are expected to show honesty, loyalty, and trustworthiness in all academic and clinical activities, holding themselves and each other accountable for the integrity of the learning community. </p>
<p>It is the responsibility of each student to review and abide by all aspects of the course syllabus and agree to familiarize and adhere to the Academic Integrity Policy. A lack of knowledge is not considered an excuse for not upholding the policy. </p>
<h2>Academic Integrity and the Academic Integrity Policy</h2>
<p>The Academic Integrity Policy prohibits cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, collusion and other forms of academic misconduct.  </p>
<p>Application of the Academic Integrity Policy is confidential. Each Academic Integrity Board (AIB) and the Administrator of the University Academic Integrity Database are responsible for holding the confidentiality of student records in academic integrity policy violations. Except in cases of suspension or expulsion, such information does not become part of the permanent academic record. </p>
<p>All supporting documentation regarding Academic Integrity violations will be archived in the Office of the Provost. As allowed by the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, faculty with a legitimate educational interest may discuss the nature of academic integrity violations and observed trends, however, student identifiers should be withheld. </p>
<h2>Reporting Violations</h2>
<p>Each student, faculty member, and other Regis University employee must recognize and refrain from any violation of academic integrity and report observed violations. All faculty are expected to use the Academic Integrity Reporting Form to document incidents of cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, collusion, and other forms of academic misconduct. </p>
<p>All suspected violations, including first-time violations, will be reported via established University processes and will be recorded in the Academic Integrity Database. Reporting all offenses, regardless of the violation level, allows the University to identify repeat offenders. All faculty have access to plagiarism and artificial intelligence detection software, which can be used with or without a student's knowledge in any Regis University course. </p>
<h2>Violations of Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>It is a violation of academic integrity to cheat, plagiarize, fabricate, collude, or otherwise misrepresent someone else’s work as your own. Academic integrity violations may occur within the context of any academic or co-curricular activity. Regis University takes very seriously violations of academic integrity, including but not limited to the following examples:</p>
<h3>Cheating</h3>
<p><em>A form of academic dishonesty in which the person misrepresents his or her mastery of the course content or clinical experience. Cheating applies to examinations, labs, written assignment, clinical experiences, online discussions, and any other form of student assessment.</em></p>
<p>Examples of cheating include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Using unauthorized materials such as a textbook, prepared notes, study aids or an electronic device during an examination</li>
	<li>Unauthorized access to or use of someone else’s computer account or computer files to complete an assignment</li>
	<li>Possessing or obtaining an examination without the instructor’s authority or prior knowledge</li>
	<li>Submission of an assignment purchased from a commercial entity (e.g., term papers, software programs, etc.) </li>
	<li>Unauthorized preprogramming of and/or access to electronic devices or learning management systems</li>
	<li>Using materials passed down from previous students, whether solicited or unsolicited </li>
	<li>Utilizing software or programs, recording/documenting, homework assistance websites, or artificial intelligence in any way that is not specifically authorized by the course instructor</li>
	<li>Copying or recording material before, during, or after an assessment or assignment for personal usage or distribution</li>
</ul>
<h3>Plagiarism</h3>
<p><em>A form of dishonesty by which the person misrepresents someone else’s words, ideas, phrases, sentences, data, or any media as his or her own or otherwise fails to properly acknowledge the source of such material through complete and accurate citations and reference lists. Both the intentional and unintentional use of work other than one's own constitutes plagiarism.</em></p>
<p>Examples of plagiarism include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Directly quoting another person’s words without the use of quotation marks and/or acknowledging the source</li>
	<li>Paraphrasing, or restating, another person’s ideas, opinions or theories without acknowledging the source</li>
	<li>Using facts, statistics, code, media, or other material taken from a source without acknowledging the source, which includes materials provided by the instructor</li>
	<li>Failing to properly cite an original source when using a secondary source</li>
	<li>Self-plagiarism occurs when a student uses his or her own previous work to fulfill assignment(s) or parts of an assignment without permission or knowledge of the current instructor(s)</li>
	<li>Utilizing artificial intelligence software in any way that is not authorized by the faculty</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fabrication</h3>

	<li>Inventing or falsifying data or source information in experiments, research projects, or other academic assignments</li>
	<li>Listing hours worked or activities performed during a clinical or service learning experience that did not occur</li>
	<li>Misrepresentation (your own, or for others) to avoid academic work by fabricating an otherwise justifiable excuse such as illness, injury, accident, personal emergency, etc. to avoid or delay timely submission of academic work, attendance, or taking of an examination, or to request an incomplete or administrative drop in the course</li>
	<li>Misrepresenting one’s contribution to scholarly research and/or publication</li>
	<li>Misrepresenting or falsifying a resume or curriculum vitae</li>
</ul>
<h3>Collusion</h3>
<p><em>A form of dishonesty involving two or more persons acting in a manner intended to misrepresent individual effort, learning and/or contributions to course assignments.</em></p>
<p>Examples of collusion include, but are not limited to the following:</p>

	<li>Searching, requesting, or sharing answers/solutions with others or online</li>
	<li>Unauthorized sharing of material and/or answers before or after an assessment</li>
	<li>Unauthorized collaboration with another person during an examination or other assignment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Examples of Academic Integrity Violations</h3>
<p>Other examples include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sharing academic work on the internet without explicit permission from the instructor (own work or otherwise)</li>
	<li>Unauthorized or inappropriate access to use of another’s computer account, access codes, or electronic files</li>
	<li>Encouraging any person to engage in academic dishonesty or misconduct</li>
	<li>Aiding or being complicit to any other person engaged in academic dishonesty or misconduct</li>
	<li>Changing, altering, falsifying, or being accessory to the changing, altering, or falsifying of a grade report or form, or entering any University office, building or accessing a computer for that purpose</li>
	<li>Denying access to scholarly resources or otherwise deliberately impeding the progress of another student or scholar. Violations in this category include but are not limited to giving other students false or misleading information; making library materials unavailable through stealing or defacement; deliberately misplacing or destroying reserve materials or altering and/or destroying someone else’s computer files.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Levels and Sanctions</h2>
<p>An offense level is first assigned by the faculty member based on the assessment of the offense and surrounding circumstances. Faculty may consult with the Chair of the College Academic Integrity Board (AIB) or a representative within the College, School, or Division to assess the level of any academic integrity violation. For violations that occur outside of an individual course, the faculty or dean receiving the report may determine the level of the offense, which may include retroactive course failure or other sanctions.</p>
<h3>Levels of Offense</h3>
<p><em>Level I:</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Unintentional violations of the academic integrity policy</li>
	<li>Offenses in which there are considered to be mitigating circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Level II:</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Deliberate violations of the academic integrity policy</li>
	<li>Subsequent Level I violations will be considered at least a Level II violation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Level III:</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Flagrant disregard for academic integrity policy, or egregious violations of the policy</li>
	<li>Subsequent Level II violations may be considered a Level III violation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Corrective Actions and/or Potential Sanctions</h3>
<p><em>Level I:</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Course penalties including resubmission of work with penalty, failure of the assignment or assessment, <strong>or</strong> failure of the course</li>
	<li>Completion of University and/or College academic integrity training modules and quiz, with a passing score of 90% or higher</li>
	<li>Written reflection</li>
	<li>Submission of assignments to the Learning Commons for review</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Level II:</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>In addition to course penalties identified above, sanctions for Level II may include failure of the assignment, failure of the course, or other appropriate remedial action as directed by the course instructor</li>
	<li>Instructional units may impose additional programmatic sanctions such as loss of leadership roles</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Level III:</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>In addition to course penalties identified above, sanctions for Level III violations may include institutional sanctions such as course failure; grade changes; program suspension; academic dismissal from a Program, School or College; denied entry into another program, School, or College; expulsion from the University; or retraction/withholding of degrees or certificates awarded by the University</li>
</ul>
<h3>Investigation and Reporting Process</h3>
<p>When a faculty suspects a violation, the faculty informs the student of the suspected violation.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the faculty determines there is not violation, the process ends</li>
	<li>If the faculty determines there is a more likely than not violation, the faculty proceeds with the next steps</li>
</ul>
<p>The faculty determines they type of offense and sanction in alignment with the Level and Sanctions guidelines under this policy. The faculty may confer with their department chair and/or representative, or chair of the College Academic Integrity Board (AIB) to determine the level and sanction for the violation. </p>
<ol>
	<li>The faculty completes the Academic Integrity Reporting Form, including a description of the violation, the determined level and sanctions, a record of communication with the student, and any additional supporting documentation (Turn-It-In report, assignment instructions, syllabus, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p>The chair of the College AIB in which the violation occurred will review the submission and checks the Academic Integrity Database for prior violations. If there are prior violations, the chair of the College AIB may consult with the reporting faculty, degree program chair, and/or College AIB to determine the appropriate level of violation and sanctions. </p>
<h5>Level I Violations</h5>
<p>1. The College AIB notifies the student of the violation and sanctions, including the information on the appeal process. </p>
<h5>Subsequent Level I, Level II, or Level III Violations</h5>
<ol>
	<li> The chair of the College AIB notifies the student of the charge, provides, or summarizes the evidence that substantiates the change and informs the student that they may provide any relevant documentation in their defense before the AIB's review. The AIB will return a decision within 10 business days.  </li>
	<li>The College AIB in which the violation occurred may include a representative from the student's home college if applicable. </li>
	<li>The College AIB reviews the evidence. If the preponderance of evidence supports the fact that a violation occurred, the College AIB will recommend appropriate sanctions. The chair of the college AIB communicates with all relevant parties (student, student's advisor, dean, etc. if necessary). </li>
	<li>
	<p>The violation and summary sanction are communicated to the student in writing by the College AIB and the documentation is added to the Academic Integrity Reporting Form.</p>
	</li>
	<li>The student has the right to appeal to the College AIB. </li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Appeals Process</span></h3>
<p>Students have the right to appeal findings of academic dishonesty, or the sanction for violations at any level. </p>
<p> The following process will be followed:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The student submits a written request for appeal to the AIB of the College in which the alleged violation occurred within <strong>five business days</strong> of receiving notification that there was a finding that they violated the Academic Integrity Policy.</li>
</ol>
<ul style="margin-left:40px">
	<li>It is the student's responsibility to provide information and data supporting their appeal. The appeal must focus on the current issue as extraneous circumstances will not be considered within the appeal process. </li>
</ul>
<p>2. Appeals may be based only on the following grounds:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:40px">
	<li>A procedural error occurred that significantly impacted the outcome of the initial review, such as substantiated bias, conflict of interest, or a deviation from established procedures.</li>
	<li>The outcomes imposed are grossly disproportionate to the offense (including any consideration of the student's prior offenses).</li>
	<li>New information not presented during the initial review is discovered. New evidence will only be considered if the information was previously unavailable and could substantially impact the original decision or sanction. A summary of this new evidence and the potential impact must be included in the appeal and submitted by the appeal deadline.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. The College AIB convenes to consider the appeal within ten business days of receiving the student's written appeal, unless an alternate date is agreed upon by the parties involved.  </p>
<ul style="margin-left:40px">
	<li>The College AIB solicits at least one faculty representative from another College’s AIB and student representation if desired to compose the Appeals Board. Members of the Appeals Board may recuse themselves if they are the course faculty or directly involved in the circumstances of the violation.</li>
	<li>The Appeals Board may gather relevant facts and evidence from the students, witnesses, faculty, staff and submitted documentation from all parties.</li>
	<li>The Chair of the Appeals Board will be from the College where the violation occurred.</li>
</ul>
<p>4. The Appeals Board renders a decision within five business days of convening. </p>
<ul style="margin-left:40px">
	<li>If the student appeal is successful, the charge, violation, and/or sanction can be modified or reversed. If a violation is deemed not to have occurred, this information is recorded in the database or student’s record/file.</li>
	<li>If the student appeal is denied, the charge, the violation, and/or the sanction are upheld. </li>
	<li>A decision letter is sent to the student, student's advisor, and other parties as appropriate. </li>
</ul>
<p>5. An individual may appeal the finding of the AIB's appeal decision to the University Provost within five business days of the Appeal Board's written decision only if the process was not followed or new evidence is available that would nullify the finding of the Appeals Board. The decision of the Provost is final and may not be appealed. </p>
<h2><span>University Academic Integrity Policy Review</span></h2>
<p>The University Academic Integrity Officer serves at the pleasure of the Provost, and is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Convening Academic Integrity Board Chairs from the Colleges as needed to review process and policy issues.</li>
	<li>Collecting and dispersing as appropriate, records of reported academic integrity violations</li>
	<li>Recommending revisions to this policy as needed, in collaboration with University Counsel and Academic Integrity Officers.</li>
	<li>Collaborating on the creation and maintenance of educational resources for students and faculty related to academic integrity</li>
</ul>
<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Application of the Academic Integrity Policy is confidential.  It is the responsibility of each AIB and the administrator of the University Academic Integrity Database to ensure the confidentiality of student records in academic integrity policy violations.  Except in cases of suspension or expulsion, such information does not become part of the permanent academic record.</p>
<p>All communications and rationale for Board Decisions are confidential and only available to the reporting faculty, AIB, the student’s advisor and Program Chair unless the violation and sanction impacts the student’s progression in a program.</p>
<h2>University Learning Outcomes: The Regis Nine</h2>
<p>For centuries, the Jesuits have been perfecting an educational tradition of academic excellence, values-centered education, and service to the community. As a Jesuit institution, Regis University is deeply embedded within that heritage. Central to the tradition is the fact that the mission of the University is the driving force behind all educational programs. The mission can be no less central when the issue of assessment of student academic achievement is engaged.</p>
<p>From our mission, a set of University-wide Outcome Statements were developed. The goal of developing these statements was to transform our mission and educational goals into explicit and ultimately measurable declarations that capture the collective thinking of the faculties of the University. In effect, the University Outcome Statements have become the operational foundation for assessment of student academic achievement.</p>
<p>These University-wide learning outcomes are broad-based and address every aspect of the University mission related to student learning and academic achievement, including learning within a specific academic discipline or cross-disciplinary area and learning in general education. The statements also identify the need for graduates to be well prepared for lives of work and service. Finally, the University Outcome Statements encompass some of the critical attitudes and personal values Regis feels are important for citizenship in a global society.</p>
<p>The University Outcome Statements are listed below. All students graduating from Regis University should have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In-depth knowledge of a discipline or content area.</li>
	<li>Knowledge of diverse cultures, perspectives, and belief systems.</li>
	<li>Knowledge of arts, sciences, and humanities.</li>
	<li>Ability to think critically.</li>
	<li>Ability to communicate effectively.</li>
	<li>Ability to use contemporary technology.</li>
	<li>Commitment to ethical and social responsibilities.</li>
	<li>Commitment to leadership and service to others.</li>
	<li>Commitment to learning as a lifelong endeavor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past decade, the assessment of student academic achievement has gained a prominent place on the agendas of institutions of higher education. The Higher Learning Commission indicated in 1991 that a formal plan for outcomes assessment would be required to maintain accreditation.</p>
<p>Regis University engages in the important work of student learning assessment not to comply with our accreditor’s mandate, but to ensure that we deliver on the promises made to Regis students through the Regis Nine institutional learning outcomes and through program-specific learning outcomes.  All instructional, co-curricular and operational units at Regis University complete this work through active participation in the R.U. Learning assessment plan, which is accessible at <a href="https://www.regis.edu/assessment" target="_blank">www.regis.edu/assessment</a>.</p>
<h2>Credit Hour Definition and Contact Hours</h2>
<p>Jesuit education is characterized as person-centered and academically rigorous in the search for truth and an understanding of justice. Any relevant definition of credit hour must be consistent with these principles. As such, every Regis University course has designated student learning outcomes. The definition of the credit hour is based on time spent in instructor-led learning activities that are directed toward the student learning outcomes. For example, a three credit course must include a minimum of 45 hours of instructor-led learning activities that are directed toward achieving the course learning outcomes. Students are required to engage in additional activities such as studying, reading, researching, performing, etc. outside class time, but these activities are not counted toward the 45 contact hours. </p>
<p>To access the full Regis University policy regarding credit hours, please see <a href="https://www.regis.edu/policies/contact-hours" target="_blank">https://www.regis.edu/policies/contact-hours</a></p>
<h3><span>Student Complaint Policy</span></h3>
<p>Regis University is a Jesuit Catholic University committed to excellence in its programs and services; it exists for the purposes of teaching and learning.  It is accountable to its students, other constituents, and its institutional accrediting body to ensure that students have access to appropriate procedures for registering complaints regarding actions, decisions, and/or processes so their complaints may be deliberated and acted upon by appropriate University officials.</p>
<p>This policy applies to all Regis University students regardless of department, division, school, college, status, classification, type, or location. No retaliation shall be taken against a student who articulates a complaint.</p>
<p>Regis University designates its individual departments and operational units as responsible for receiving, investigating and potentially resolving student complaints. Depending upon the nature of the complaint, there are specific policies and procedures, as detailed below.</p>
<h3>Violations of the Student Code of Conduct or the Nondiscrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy</h3>
<p>The Regis University Student Handbook describes in detail information regarding judicial affairs, student grievances, conduct hearings, appeals and related procedures. The Student Handbook is available at <a href="https://www.regis.edu/life-at-regis/student-affairs/student-handbook" target="_blank">https://www.regis.edu/life-at-regis/student-affairs/student-handbook</a></p>
<p> In accordance with the University’s Nondiscrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy <em>(described fully in the Regis University Student Handbook and also available at <a href="https://www.regis.edu/life-at-regis/student-resources/campus-safety/equal-opportunity-and-title-ix-compliance" target="_blank">https://www.regis.edu/life-at-regis/student-resources/campus-safety/equal-opportunity-and-title-ix-compliance</a></em>, any complaint or grievance pertaining to discrimination against persons of a protected class or pertaining to sexual misconduct will be referred to the University’s Equal Opportunity &amp; Title IX Coordinator for investigation. The Equal Opportunity &amp; Title IX Coordinator shall maintain records of the appeals and of the disposition thereof.</p>
<h3>Academic Complaints</h3>
<p>Most academic concerns can be resolved informally by speaking directly with the individual; this approach is encouraged. If the issue is not resolved, students who have a complaint against a faculty member or academic administrator regarding an academic concern are expected to pursue the complaint resolution processes established in their specific division, school, and college. College specific complaint processes are published on the websites of each college and/or in the college section of this catalog. Current and previous catalogs can be found at <a href="https://www.regis.edu/academics/catalogs-and-calendars" target="_blank">https://www.regis.edu/academics/catalogs-and-calendars</a>.</p>
<p>The three colleges of Regis University are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Anderson College of Business and Computing</li>
	<li>Regis College</li>
	<li>Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions</li>
</ul>
<p>For concerns pertaining to grades and/or progression, the decision of the College’s academic dean shall be final.</p>
<h3>Complaints Regarding Non-Academic Services</h3>
<p>Students with a complaint regarding non-academic services must notify the person or head of the office responsible for the service to seek to resolve the situation by discussing the concern directly with the party involved within 30 calendar days of the incident and otherwise follow the procedures for appealing a decision within the unit. For example, concerns or appeals related to disability services, financial aid, parking or residence life must be addressed through the processes set up by those departments. For further information please call:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Disability Services: 303.458.4941 or <a href="mailto:disability@regis.edu">disability@regis.edu</a></li>
	<li>Student Accounts: 303.458.4126 or<a href="mailto:stuaccts@regis.edu"> stuaccts@regis.edu</a></li>
	<li>Financial Aid 303.458.4900 or <a href="financialaid@regis.edu">financialaid@regis.edu</a></li>
	<li>Residence Life: 303.964.3628 or <a href="mailto:reslife@regis.edu">reslife@regis.edu</a></li>
	<li>Parking tickets: 303-964-5353 or <a href="mailto:ruparking@regis.edu">ruparking@regis.edu</a></li>
	<li>Bookstore: 303.458.4150 or <a href="mailto:regisuniversity@bkstr.com">regisuniversity@bkstr.com</a></li>
	<li>Cafeteria (Harvest Table): 303.458.4196</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is not a formal procedure to appeal a particular decision, most concerns can be resolved by speaking directly with the individual. Therefore, a student with a grievance must first notify the person or office responsible to seek a resolution. Such notification should be in writing and should be submitted within thirty days of becoming aware of the grievance.</p>
<h3>Formal Complaint</h3>
<p>In limited circumstances, a student may file a formal complaint using the policy identified below. The formal complaint must be filed within 14 days of the student receiving a unit level decision or appeal decision, whichever is final. Alternatively, if a student does not receive a reply from the unit, the student may file a formal complaint within 30 days of the initial written notification of a grievance to the unit. The only basis for a formal complaint is that the applicable policy or procedure has not been followed or applied.</p>
<h3>Formal Instructional Complaint</h3>
<p>Appeals of academic issues (<em>other than grades or progression</em>) beyond a college’s academic dean may be made in writing to the Office of the Provost within 14 calendar days of the decision of the unit’s dean or director, using the process described below. The Office of the Provost will make the final decision and will notify the student of the decision within 14 calendar days of receipt of the complaint, as described below.</p>
<p>Complete records of such formal academic complaints (other than grades or progression), and records of their disposition, are maintained by the Office of the Provost.</p>
<h3>Formal Non-Instructional Complaint</h3>
<p>Appeals of a non-academic decision beyond a unit’s dean or director may be made in writing to the Office of the President within 14 calendar days of the head of the unit’s decision using the process described below. The Office of the President will make the final decision and will notify the student of the decision within 14 days of receipt of the complaint, as described below.</p>
<p>Complete records of such formal non-academic complaints, and records of their disposition, are maintained by the Office of the President.</p>
<h4>Formal Complaint Process</h4>
<p>A formal complaint must be made in writing, and include the following information:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Student’s name, Regis I.D. number, mailing address, and telephone number.</li>
	<li>A detailed description of the specific actions that constitute the basis for the complaint and the names and titles of those involved.</li>
	<li>The dates of the alleged actions.</li>
	<li>A list of witnesses, if any, including their contact information and the facts known by each.</li>
	<li>Documentation that supports the complaint.</li>
	<li>Evidence that the student has already attempted to resolve the concern through the informal dialogue and unit level resolution, as described above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon receipt of a formal complaint, the Office of the Provost or the Office of the President, as appropriate, will acknowledge receipt of the complaint within 7 working days. Normally, complaints will be investigated and resolved within 14 calendar days.</p>
<p>The administrator in receipt of the complaint will advise the complainant if that timeline will not be met. The office in receipt of the complaint will issue a written determination of the complaint which will be provided to the student and the affected unit or other individual.</p>
<p>If it is evident the complaint has not been previously addressed by the appropriate college/school/division/unit for investigation and proposed resolution, the complaint may be referred to the correct level for a decision. The office that receives the complaint may overturn, modify, or uphold the previous decision made by the head of the unit.</p>
<p>The decision of the Office of the Provost or the Office of the President shall be final.</p>
