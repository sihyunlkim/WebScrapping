<p>With our campuses getting quiet, the temperatures down in the double digits in Arizona, and some snowflakes in the air in Kansas and Wisconsin, it&rsquo;s beginning to feel like the end of another fall semester.</p>

<p>With 2025 here, all of us in the Ottawa University community can reflect with pride on our accomplishments over the past year, look forward to exciting prospects ahead, and celebrate our shared work of preparing students for &ldquo;lifetimes of personal significance, vocational fulfillment, and service to God and humanity.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2024, we launched a new academic structure, cheered our teams on to records and titles (including our fourth straight national championship in flag football), successfully reaffirmed our accreditation with the Higher Learning Commission, moved to beautiful new campus locations in Kansas City and Wisconsin, continued to make significant progress on our strategic plan, and announced OU Forever More, the most ambitious fundraising campaign in Ottawa University history.&nbsp; The coming year promises to be no less busy or consequential for the University, with a number of new academic programs in the pipeline, a transformative software and systems transition set to go live, a major update to our general education curriculum underway, and a very long list of grants to write, donors to visit, budgets to balance, strategic priorities to advance, and (of course) students to teach, coach, inspire, support, serve, and send boldly out into the world.</p>

<p>The holidays are a time for thankfulness and, as always, I feel particularly grateful for the extended Ottawa University family&mdash;the faculty and staff, students, parents and guardians, alumni, volunteers, friends, and supporters&mdash;who make our &ldquo;Christ-inspired community of grace and open inquiry&rdquo; so special and so particularly vital in a historical moment of change, challenge, and opportunity.</p>

<p>May you and your family have a peaceful, restorative, and blessed holiday season.&nbsp; On behalf of all of us at Ottawa University, Happy New Year!</p>

<h2><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>OUKS Events Elevate Business Knowledge</strong></span></h2>

<p><em><span style="color:#800000;">Students Schooled at Bundy Etiquette Dinner and PPEfest</span></em></p>

<p>Two events a week apart on the Ottawa University &ndash; Kansas campus allowed students to gain new knowledge and skills that will elevate their professional acumen and provide insight into the relation between business and other societal systems.</p>

<p><strong><em>Appetite for Etiquette</em></strong></p>

<p>On Thursday, November 27, 30 business students and multiple faculty and staff were treated to the third annual Bundy Etiquette Dinner in the Hasty/Goppert conference rooms of the Gangwish Library. Decked out in their professional finest, both undergraduate and post graduate students enjoyed a meal that imitated what a professional business dinner might look like. Throughout the evening, they were taught about proper dinner etiquette, how to &ldquo;dress for success,&rdquo; and how to conduct themselves professionally as they prepare to enter the business world.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Appetite for Etiquette&rdquo; evening started with the opportunity to get professional headshots which students can use on their LinkedIn or other business profile. They also mingled with their peers and faculty members over mocktails and hors d&#39;oeuvres. At 6:30 p.m., attendees were served a three-course meal, with a presentation and demonstration throughout on the proper etiquette for such events.</p>

<p>Students learned how to shake hands, introduce themselves, and where to place name tags; the anatomy of a table setting; where to put the napkin when they leave the table or finish eating; which cutlery to use and when; how to pass items at the table; and bread etiquette, among other protocols. They were also taught the dress code for different types of professional events and about the kinds of conversations to have at a business dinner, which they practiced with their peers and table heads throughout the evening.</p>

<p>Senior Nayeli Acosta enjoyed the evening, saying, &ldquo;This event was very informative, and the food was delicious. Freshman Jatelynn Pollet also commented, &ldquo;It was really fun to go deeper into these things than just learning the basics.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Multiple faculty and staff attended the event, including OU Provost Dr. Joanna Bangs, Assistant Professor of Economic Education Dr. Peter Jacobsen, Dean of the Angell Snyder School of Business Dr. Marylou DeWald, Assistant Professor of Accounting Michelle Corbin, Assistant to the President Dr. Murle Mordy, and the OU Career Development team, Katie Hornbeck and Bekah Wadkins, who helped students access formal attire for the evening, if needed. Assistant Dean for Academic Operations Collen Huffman and Director of Career Development Christine Currier assisted with the event but were unable to attend.</p>

<p>The Bundy dinner was started in the fall of 2022 by former Accounting Professor Lyn Wagner. It is now sponsored by the Bundy Program, which is headed by Jacobsen. The program is an accounting and finance program that was created to honor the legacy and dedication of Robert &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; N. Bundy to Ottawa University students and their families. Bundy was the business manager, budget director and a teacher at OU who assisted many generations of students.</p>

<p><em><span style="color:#B22222;"><strong>Philosophy, Politics and Economics Fest</strong></span> </em></p>

<p>The annual Philosophy, Politics and Economics Fest (PPEfest), hosted by the Ottawa University Gwartney Institute, expanded this year to include an &ldquo;on the road&rdquo; version of the recruiting experience, in addition to the campus event. PPEfest allows students to interactively explore the connectivity of the three systems, be introduced to a variety of economics concepts, hear a renowned guest speaker, and meet the OU Gwartney Institute faculty. Each student receives a $50 honorarium for attending.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, November 13, the PPEfest team traveled to Wichita to present to 18 juniors and seniors at Freedom Preparatory Academy. Assistant Professor of Economic Education Dr. Peter Jacobsen led off with a &ldquo;prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma&rdquo; game that demonstrated the thought process of making difficult strategic decisions in economics.</p>

<p>Next, Assistant Professor of Philosophy Dr. Justin Clarke engaged students in a multi-layered, interactive thought experiment which explored the moral and ethical quandaries of choosing to sacrifice one person to save a larger number of people who are about to be hit by a runaway trolley.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, Professor of Economics Dr. Russ McCullough led a discussion on the benefits of trade and individual economic freedom by exploring why some countries are rich and others are poor. Afterwards, while enjoying pizza, students gained additional exposure to what the OU Institute program offers by listening to PPE-relevant &ldquo;commercials&rdquo; that undergraduate students created as part of a PPE League intercollegiate competition, another event the Gwartney Institute hosts each year.</p>

<p>From the responses of both students and administrators, the event was a resounding success. &ldquo;I appreciated the new information that gave me new light on economics and the world in general . . . and on thinking outside the box or more critically,&rdquo; said one.</p>

<p>Another commented, &ldquo;This was the best group of guests at our school we&#39;ve ever had! It was incredible, interesting and easy to understand in a fun way! I kind of felt like I was the one who should&#39;ve given them 50 dollars. I&#39;m extremely interested in Ottawa University now too.&rdquo; A total of five students expressed interest in coming to OU for a campus tour as a result of the event.</p>

<p>Yet another participant focused on the faculty presenters. &ldquo;The professors clearly had a strong grasp on what was being taught and conveyed their knowledge to the classroom. It was easy to follow and understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Candace Fish, director of the Academy, was encouraged by the student response. &ldquo;They absolutely loved the activities and the higher-level thinking,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The teacher that was in there said she loved that the kids that don&#39;t usually participate in discussion were involved and seemed interested.&nbsp;All in all, it was a great day, and I would highly recommend it to other schools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During PPEfest, McCullough shared the role of the Gwartney Institute with the students. &ldquo;One student in particular was impressed to learn that students enrolled in different majors can participate in the Gwartney Institute events. When she asked if we had an art major, I was able to connect her with Brianne Fulton-Miller, who heads up our art program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two days after the Wichita PPEfest, on November 15, the event was duplicated on the OUKS campus for 16 high school students who came from Ottawa, Garnett and Lyndon, KS, and as far away as Houston, TX. Their response to the experience was similar to those in Wichita. &ldquo;This was a great opportunity!&rdquo; commented one. &ldquo;I learned so much that I didn&#39;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In addition to the afternoon&rsquo;s games and presentations, attendees of the campus PPEfest, along with 40 undergraduate OU students and a number of professors and administrators, were also treated to a special dinner with guest speaker Dr. Christopher J. Boudreaux. Boudreaux is an associate professor in the economics department at Florida Atlantic University, research fellow for the Phil Smith Center, and an editor at Small Business Economics. His teaching and research expertise are in entrepreneurship and innovation, and he is the author of more than 40 peer-reviewed articles. Boudreaux spoke on &ldquo;Encouraging Entrepreneurship - What kind of environment stimulates discovery and innovation of new products and services?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Students are better when they understand the world around them beyond the classroom,&rdquo; emphasized McCullough.&nbsp;&ldquo;Philosophy, Politics, and Economics all contribute to students being mindful of the many things that effect everyday decisions. It is great to engage with prospective students and give them a better understanding of how PPE is all around them and to introduce how an Ottawa University education can help them stand out in the real world.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span style="color:#800000;">Serving Up Drama with a Side of Dessert</span></h2>

<p><span style="color:#800000;"><em>OUAZ Theatre Club Gets New Space</em></span></p>

<p>Created in 2022, the OUAZ Theatre Club was established not only for students, but also as a community facing program that welcomes Surprise, AZ residents of all ages to participate. To date, the young club&rsquo;s performances have taken place in various locations in the city, such as Willow Canyon High School and The Vista Center for the Performing Arts, with popular productions like &ldquo;Barefoot in the Park&rdquo;, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Good Man Charlie Brown&rdquo;, &ldquo;Seussical&rdquo; and &ldquo;Little Shop of Horrors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This fall, however, the club received a nod from the University with a new designated black box theatre space in Eichner Hall. Prior to OUAZ becoming a residential campus, the room was a salon as part of Rio Salado College&rsquo;s Communiversity, of which Ottawa University was a part. It later became the new OUAZ campus&rsquo;s temporary food services area, with a header above the room that read &ldquo;Life is Uncertain, Eat Dessert First!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now that Room 1010 has been transformed into a 1,200 square foot theatre, the club has decided to lean into the space&rsquo;s history by leaving the header over the door and offering dessert prior to each show. &ldquo;We want to honor where we came from,&rdquo; said Theatre Program Manager Lauren Frazier. &ldquo;And, it gives us an excuse to eat dessert!&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>The new black box theatre seats up to 75 guests and includes a makeup/changing room and storage for props and costumes. Still in the building and remodeling stage, OUAZ is seeking in-kind donations, grants and funds to add professional lighting and sound equipment to the theatre.</p>

<p>The club&rsquo;s most recent and first student-directed production in the new theatre involved the entire theatre crew of 19 students and several community members. It was a two-part performance on Saturday, November 16, with showings at 4:00 and 7:00 p.m. First up (after dessert, of course!) was Brent Holland&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Candidate,&rdquo; a one-act play directed by junior engineering student Leo Wyatt.</p>

<p>It was followed by a number of Broadway vocal selections performed by community talent eager to share their voices with the audience. The vocals were directed by sophomore elementary education student Karlynn Edwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was amazing to watch these two take leadership roles and lead their fellow classmates and community members,&rdquo; beamed Frazier. &ldquo;Theatre requires a village, and it is fun to see how these students bring their individual talents together to create something bigger than themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While OUAZ doesn&rsquo;t currently offer a theatre major, students who actively participate in the theatre club are eligible for scholarships, whether they are acting, directing or working on crews for set, sound, lighting, costumes, and marketing.&nbsp; Junior Chris Whitwell is currently president of the club and has benefited from the club in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been involved in almost every show since the club&rsquo;s inception,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done set building, support acting, background dancing, front of house, and assistant writing. Most recently I was the stage manager for the first time in our new space.&nbsp;I have also been a co-host for OUAZ-TV, doing the weekly school announcements for the past three years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a double major in psychology and business leadership and management, Whitwell appreciates the ability for any student to be involved in the club and gain from the experience.&nbsp;&ldquo;Even though I&rsquo;m not interested in theatre as a job, I have been able to use the skills that I have acquired in the program in professional aspects, [like doing] the voiceover for the message of the president of my Tribal Native Corporation in Alaska a couple of years ago, giving better presentations for classes and internships, and being able to teach a workshop at OUAZ this term.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Understanding the importance of the arts, the City of Surprise has been a big supporter of the Theatre Club, awarding a few grants for the group. OUAZ President Dr. Dennis Tyner, an avid actor himself, is also a great advocate for this program. &ldquo;His vision and servant leadership have created opportunity to do great things that have a positive and lasting effect, not only on the University, but in the community, as well,&rdquo; shared Frazier.</p>

<p>One effect the drama club has had on the community is through its partnership with an organization called &ldquo;VetTix,&rdquo; which provides free tickets to veterans and their families, an often forgotten demographic.</p>

<p>U.S. Air Force Veteran John shared his experience from a previous production. &ldquo;What a fun evening! I brought my 11-year-old son and nine-year-old granddaughter, and we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We would never have known about this if it wasn&rsquo;t for VetTix. Thank you for all you do in bringing fun family entertainment to our community and veterans. Thank you, Ottawa University!! Very well done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is just one of many positive comments the program receives from attendees. &ldquo;There are so many beautiful things that people have sent us,&rdquo; noted Frazier. &ldquo;It is a constant reminder that we don&rsquo;t do theatre for ourselves, but to serve our community through the arts. OUAZ Theatre produces quality multi-generational theatrical performances that add value to the cultural atmosphere of Surprise. I look forward to the next piece of art that the club creates.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span style="color:#800000;">OUWI Holds Grand Opening</span></h2>

<p><font color="#800000"><i>New Campus Ushers in New Chapter</i></font></p>

<p>Tuesday evening, November 12, saw the official grand opening of OU &ndash; Wisconsin&rsquo;s new Brookfield campus, its first new building in 18 years and third location since the site launched in 1992.</p>

<p>Surrounded by alumni, students, current and former faculty and staff, community members, as well as various OU trustees and administrators, the evening was filled with tours of the new facility, networking over appetizers, and a program that was both reflective and future focused.</p>

<p>Director of OU &ndash; Wisconsin Campus Operations Brian Patterson &rsquo;04/MBA &#39;10 welcomed guests and recognized a number of special people associated with the move to the new facility, including Dan Jessup and Patrick Savoie from JLL Brokers; David Fricker, president of Integrity Construction; Andrea DeLaune, John Weishan, Alex Blitman, Dan Marjenka, and Thom Hamp from JLL Property Management Team; OU Chancellor Dr. Bill Tsutsui; Vice Chancellor for University Advancement Janet Peters; Chair of the Board of Trustees Danny Trent; and Vice Chair of the Board Janet Kincaid.</p>

<p>Following a prayer of blessing by University Chaplain Rev. Dr. John Holzhüter, Patterson shared the history of the campus in Brookfield. Starting with its opening in 1992, he described how the campus in the Wisconsin market was a direct result of the growth Ottawa University was experiencing in its adult markets in Kansas City. Capitalizing on that success, the University repeated the well-vetted model of permanent and adjunct faculty, student-friendly transfer policies, proven academic programs, rented space, and a prominent location adjacent to a major highway corridor.</p>

<p>Dr. Don Clauser, who served as provost of the original Brookfield campus from 1994 through 2006, was in attendance for the grand opening of the new campus. Patterson recounted how Clauser&rsquo;s mantra, &ldquo;Steady as she goes,&rdquo; served OU &ndash; Wisconsin well and allowed it to prosper under his leadership. He was later joined by such influencers as Dr. Wade Mauland, Dr. Rhoda Miller, Jacqueline Daly, and Elaine George, among others, to turn the campus into one of OU&rsquo;s highest performing adult units, graduating more than 2,500 students to date.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/Ottawa/media/ou/OU%20Update/IMG_3290-Bill-350x450.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" />The Wisconsin campus became a leader in OU academic affairs, pioneering some of the most recent innovations necessitated by today&rsquo;s rapidly changing student demographic and academic profile. In 2009, OU - Wisconsin also became the first adult campus to consistently work with a local alumni association board of directors chapter, celebrating 15 years in 2024.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We honor our 32-year history in Brookfield today with our continued commitment to serving students, partners, alumni, and the community,&rdquo; shared Patterson. &ldquo;It is with great pride that we celebrate the Grand Opening of our new campus at this premier site location. This professional and student-centered space will allow us to continue to offer quality educational opportunities while building a brighter future for our community. We&rsquo;re honored to have you here with us today to embark on this exciting new journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That journey began when the lease on OU &ndash; Wisconsin&rsquo;s old building was set to expire. The University took the opportunity to expand the campus&rsquo;s footprint to accommodate the growing needs of students and provide them with an elevated experience. The need for expanded space became particularly evident with the regrowth and success of the International EMBA program.</p>

<p>The new, fully refurbished facility at 15800 W. Bluemound Road in Brookfield boasts 3,344 square feet of strategically located first floor space. It provides triple the common/shared space of the previous campus that includes an outdoor patio, a business conference center, dining area, student lounge/café, 24-hour fitness center for employees, and plenty of technology-enabled offices and classrooms.</p>

<p>Following his remarks, Patterson welcomed Tsutsui and Peters to the stage to share the exciting launch of the University&rsquo;s $35M OU Forever More capital campaign that will benefit all OU campuses and programs (<a href="/ottawauniversityupdate/overview#Update_SpecFeat_Campaign">see Special Feature here</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In order to realize our vision at this pivotal moment, we will need to call once again on all who this University has touched and all who are inspired by our plans, to join us in writing the next chapter in Ottawa&rsquo;s rich history,&rdquo; shared Tsutsui. &ldquo;Thus, tonight we are thrilled to launch publicly the largest campaign in Ottawa University&rsquo;s history. With a goal of 35 million dollars, it is as bold as our vision is. We are calling the campaign OU Forever More: One Spirit, Endless Possibilities.&rdquo; Tsutsui also shared that $15M has been raised towards the campaign to date.</p>

<p>Following the campaign announcement, Patterson closed out the evening by specially recognizing his colleagues, Demetrius Anderson, Leigh-Anne-Iverson Sommers, Susan Slonac, and Dr. Stephen Weiss for their daily work and support and by thanking the evening&rsquo;s sponsor, Siggenauk Center Food Pantry. &ldquo;We have a lot to celebrate with endless possibilities for Ottawa University&rsquo;s future,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had the honor of attending the Grand Opening celebration at Ottawa University&rsquo;s new Brookfield location,&rdquo; said adjunct faculty member Mary Alice Grosser. &ldquo;It was a wonderful evening to celebrate yet another chapter in OU -Wisconsin&rsquo;s campus journey. As a faculty member of Ottawa for almost 10 years now, I know how dedicated Ottawa is to their students, and the new facility takes that dedication to the next level.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><span style="color:#B22222;"><strong>University Launches $35M OU Forever More Campaign </strong></span></h3>

<p><span style="color:#B22222;"><em>One Spirit. Endless Possibilities.</em></span></p>

<p>At events on each of OU&rsquo;s four campuses over the past two months, Chancellor Dr. Bill Tsutsui and Vice Chancellor for Advancement Janet Peters announced the launch of the most ambitious capital campaign in the University&rsquo;s history - OU Forever More, a $35 million comprehensive campaign that will run through 2028.</p>

<p>Taking inspiration from the Braves fight song long sung on the OUKS campus, the campaign appropriated the song&rsquo;s resounding call to victory to the sweeping appeal to propel OU&rsquo;s vision forward:</p>

<p><em>See, the OU tide is turning,<br />
Gaining more and more.<br />
Then fight, fight, fight,<br />
For we win tonight:<br />
OU Forever More.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;While the campaign&rsquo;s name comes from the Braves fight song, the tagline, &lsquo;One Spirit. Endless Possibilities.&rsquo; comes from our whole community, from the collective hopes of our strategic planning process and from the future we are striving to achieve,&rdquo; Tsutsui explained.</p>

<p>That strategic planning began three years ago when representatives of OU&rsquo;s faculty, staff, and students, along with trustees, community members, and other stakeholders came together to reflect on how far the institution had come, where it stood now, and what the future held. The strategic plan that emerged from the inclusive, grassroots process grew not only from the group&rsquo;s collective hopes, but also from a clear-eyed sense of the focus required to flourish in the competitive landscape of higher education today.</p>

<p>Three primary areas surfaced as imperative for campaign investment in order to sustain Ottawa University&rsquo;s upward trajectory, realize the bold vision for OU&rsquo;s future, and advance its time-honored mission of service and impact.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Expand Opportunity &ndash; Goal $10 million</em></strong>

	<ul>
		<li>Establish endowed scholarship funds that keep Ottawa University&rsquo;s life-changing education accessible to all</li>
		<li>Fund essential scholarship aid to support student retention and timely graduation.</li>
		<li>Fortify Ottawa University&rsquo;s endowment to ensure the University&rsquo;s long-term&nbsp;financial strength and flourishing</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>&ldquo;Ottawa University provided us with a solid foundation to build our lives on,&rdquo; shared Board of Trustees Member Michael Jones &rsquo;16 and Chair of the OU Alumni Association Board Regan (Aeschliman) Jones &rsquo;16. &ldquo;Through our own college experience and the support of our strong alumni network, we have felt empowered to chart our own futures with confidence and purpose and hope to help the next generation of Braves do the same.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Realize High Academic Ambitions &ndash; Goal $12.5 million</em></strong>

	<ul>
		<li>Invest in new and existing programs that address strong student demand and acute workforce needs, including engineering and business</li>
		<li>Accelerate the assertive agenda of growth in Ottawa University&rsquo;s offerings in health science fields like nursing, counseling, and physician assistant studies</li>
		<li>Provide essential funding for initiatives that support our highest performing students, advance experiential learning, and further excellence in teaching and advising</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>&ldquo;Our faculty, with their high expectations, play a crucial role in our students&rsquo; success,&rdquo; said Dr. Diann DeWitt, associate professor of nursing and MSN program director. &ldquo;How rewarding it is to watch students exceed what they thought possible. As the Ottawa University Faculty President, I value my faculty colleagues&rsquo; conscientious efforts to propel students to achieve excellence in their chosen fields. The university&rsquo;s culture promotes collegiality, community, and belonging that embraces students, faculty, staff, and administration. Collectively, we endeavor to expect and support our students&rsquo; high academic achievement.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Elevate the Student Experience &ndash; Goal $12.5 million</em></strong>

	<ul>
		<li>Enhance student services, such as advising, tutoring, and retention programs</li>
		<li>Boost co-curricular activities in athletics and the arts</li>
		<li>Provide essential wellbeing and emergency funding to students in need</li>
		<li>Offer students expanded career services programming, more internship opportunities, and new mentoring relationships with OU alumni</li>
		<li>Create new opportunities for study abroad and provide assistance to international students across the University</li>
		<li>Modernize and enhance campus facilities dedicated to academics, athletics, and student life in Kansas, Arizona, and Wisconsin</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>As dean of students on the OUKS campus, Donald Anderson &lsquo;13/MBA &rsquo;15 understands how important the student experience is. &ldquo;At the intersection of academics and co-curricular activities lies a rich student experience that nurtures both mind and spirit,&rdquo; he noted. &ldquo;By supporting OU Forever More, you&rsquo;re helping us boost our athletics, arts programs, and student organizations, creating a dynamic environment where students can thrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is no shortage of opportunities to get involved in the campaign, with an early focus on the endowment to strengthen the financial reserves of the University and enhance scholarship offerings. As a comprehensive campaign, all funds raised over the next three years will go towards meeting the campaign&rsquo;s $35M goal, which allows donors to give to the areas that are most meaningful to them.</p>

<p><strong><em>Endowment Gifts</em></strong> begin at a minimum of $25,000 and can come in the form of named scholarships or other endowment giving opportunities. Contributions to established endowed funds are also beneficial as they supplement existing support for students, programs like music or theater, and the University&rsquo;s faith mission. Unrestricted endowment gifts, on the other hand, are especially important to OU&rsquo;s long-term financial health. When creating a new endowment, Tsutsui and Peters strongly encourage a current-use supplemental gift at the same time so that the impact on students and faculty starts immediately.</p>

<p>Because of OU scholarships, recent graduate and Abby LaTessa &rsquo;23 was able to pursue her career dreams. &ldquo;The Nancy Evans scholarship allowed me to be able to go to nursing school and fulfill the plan God had for my life,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;As a first-generation college graduate, OU has made a lot of things possible for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong><em>Current Use Gifts</em></strong> are another way to contribute to the OU Forever More campaign. By supporting the OU Annual Fund, these gifts make an immediate impact on current students by going directly to vital needs and evolving opportunities, including essential support for student welfare, scholarships, campus programs, and intercollegiate athletics. Gifts of all sizes make a difference, and multiyear pledges or recurring gifts are particularly useful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My educational experiences at Ottawa were only possible because of the generosity of many alumni and donors,&rdquo; said Carla Coverdell &rsquo;85. &ldquo;Because of scholarships (along with grants, loans, family support, and work study), there was a way for me to gain the education and skills I needed to prepare for and pursue a teaching career which lasted nearly forty years. Making monthly contributions to scholarship funds for current and future students is a very small way to give back and help to provide for current and future OU students.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong><em>Capital Giving</em></strong> allows donors to invest in the facilities that support Ottawa University students and the beautiful, growing campuses that have inspired generations of alumni.&nbsp; Examples of capital needs include such things as laboratory equipment, athletic facilities and new or updated buildings. Giving opportunities in this category are available at all levels, while naming opportunities for selected projects begin at a minimum of $25,000.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jon &#39;81 and I are honored and excited to serve as co-chairs with Bob Evans and support OU&rsquo;s dedicated advancement team on this major campaign initiative,&rdquo; stated Jeanne Krug &rsquo;80, who is also a member of OU&rsquo;s Board of Trustees. &ldquo;Jon and I not only met at OU, but lifetime relationships with friends were forged during our time on campus and continue to this day! Whether it was on the football field (for Jon), dorm life or just being a part of campus life, OU was and continues to be a major influence and impact on our lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong><em>Planned Giving</em></strong> provides donors with the option of establishing a lasting legacy at Ottawa University through their estate or financial plan. The impact of the gift can be magnified through arrangements that may also have significant tax benefits for the donor and his or her heirs. Visit <a href="http://Ottawa.myplannedgift.org" target="_blank">Ottawa.myplannedgift.org</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>Bob Evans &rsquo;73 is co-chair of the OU Forever More campaign and a member of the Board of Trustees. &ldquo;My education from OU, and the people at the University who cared about me as a student, helped me build a pathway for a life-long career in higher education administration,&rdquo; he shared. &ldquo;So why OU? The University financially supported me in securing an education, the University gave me work experience that was the launch of my career, and the University has provided me as a Trustee the opportunity to serve my alma mater. For those who have benefited from an education at OU, we need to remember it is our obligation to &lsquo;pay it forward&rsquo; so we are paying back for those who have helped us reach our goals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 159-year legacy of Ottawa University is wide and deep, with more than 29,500 living alumni around the globe, including 131 tribal students who have graduated since OU reaffirmed its treaty with the Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma in 2008 to provide members with the opportunity to attend any of OU&rsquo;s campuses, on-ground or online, free of tuition, room and board. The University offers 51 bachelor&rsquo;s degrees, 59 master&rsquo;s degrees, and one doctoral degree in the arts and sciences, business, education, and health sciences.</p>

<p>OU&rsquo;s legacy grows stronger each year, with each division of the University experiencing continued growth and success. OUKS achieved its highest enrollment in history in 2023, with 1070 students. Generous support from alumni and other donors has fueled recent capital enhancements such as the Creed Family Greenhouse, the Hull Family Athletic Complex, and the Braves Athletic Performance Center, including the renovation of the Mabee Center.</p>

<p>Established in 2017, OUAZ has grown from an entering class of 434 students to more than 900 with the support of key donors, including John Sherman &rsquo;79 and Jim &rsquo;57 and Jeanne &rsquo;56 O&rsquo;Dell. The most recent addition to the OUAZ campus is Veritas Hall, a five-story, 59,260 sq. ft. mixed-use building providing student housing, classrooms, and office space.</p>

<p>OU Online now serves over 1,200 students in on-ground, hybrid, and online&nbsp;programs, with high enrollment in the Executive MBA, MA in Counseling,&nbsp;MS in Nursing, and undergraduate programs in Nursing (prelicensure), Elementary Education, and Human and Social Services. OU Online recently expanded into a new 29,000 sq. foot campus in Overland Park, Kansas, and a 3,000 sq. ft. campus in Brookfield, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>In athletics across the two residential campuses, Ottawa University has the largest NAIA intercollegiate athletics program in the nation. OUKS fields 33 teams, and the Braves</p>

<p>can boast 136 championships. OUAZ has 32 teams, and the Spirit have won 23&nbsp;championships since 2017.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ottawa University has stood apart from all the other institutions of higher education in America, distinguished by its unique heritage, its bold character, and its distinctive spirit,&rdquo; Tsutsui stated. &ldquo;Today, OU is riding a wave of momentum rare among American colleges and universities &ndash; a wave that other American colleges and universities can and should be envious of. None of us in higher ed can afford to be complacent, however, in a landscape of dizzying technological and economic change, political polarization, and vast demographic and cultural shifts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are asking for your support at a moment of true promise and potential,&rdquo; Tsutsui concluded. &ldquo;Ottawa University owes its establishment, resilience, and growth to the generosity of countless supporters who have recognized the timeless importance of our mission, had faith in the power of a Christ-inspired community of educators and learners, and invested in amplifying our impact on students and the world. We are deeply appreciative of your trust and your past support. And now we invite you to join us as we write the next chapter in the University&rsquo;s rich history, fired by the Ottawa Spirit, excited by the possibilities ahead, and committed to the future of OU forever more.&rdquo;</p>
