<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>

<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence, or AI,</strong>&nbsp;refers to the implementation of statistical data interpretation to application decision making. Often, AI is viewed as an omniscient tool that can access knowledge from all domains and operate in the real world using a deep understanding of fundamental knowledge. However, the reality of AI reflects challenges faced by human developers in aggregating data, acquiring computing resources and discernment of &nbsp;information quality. Artificial intelligence applications are typically limited by restrictions underpinning their development, funding, knowledge and environment.</p>

<p>General Artificial Intelligence, also known as Strong AI, refers to a type of artificial intelligence that has the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equivalent to that of a human being. It implies a machine&#39;s ability to transfer knowledge from one domain to another and self-improve through learning. However, it&#39;s important to note that no such AI currently exists that can fully match human intelligence across all domains.</p>

<p>Methods used to build machine learning models are still valuable when selectively applied to their specific domain. Models are built to specialize on different domains of expertise.</p>

<p>For example, popular AI chatbot ChatGPT uses a large collection of model attributes to determine the probability of text output in a conversation. The model is trained entirely on text input and generates data based on the likelihood of each word that is generated. Because the text output is not based on an intuitive understanding of the content it ingests and is instead based on probable outputs, this makes the tool unreliable as a sole source of truth for investigators. However, ChatGPT excels in natural language processing tasks where operations are not based on understandings outside of related text. Read section&nbsp;<a href="#Prompt Engineering"><u>&quot;Prompt Engineering&quot;</u>&nbsp;</a>for question examples and additional insights on effective use of AI language tools.</p>

<h2 id="GenerativeAIServiceCatalog-FoundationalModels">Foundational Models</h2>

<p><strong>Foundational Models or FMs</strong>&nbsp;are machine learning models trained on broad sets of unlabeled data. Machine learning models are developed to gain context into relevance into a specific attribute and can be combined with other models to integrate new knowledge and derive new skills. Most of these smaller models begin with specific datasets (topics, speech patterns, semantics, etc.) to recognize sets of trends and are combined into Foundational Models as a starting point for applications using machine learning . After packaging, they can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks and fine-tuned for an array of applications.</p>

<p>These models are typically trained by groups independent from the University and can operate unexpectedly, harbor biases and exclude current information. It is important not to confuse the statistically determined output of a machine learning model with verified research based on fact-checking and true understanding. The use of external Foundational Models in investigative discovery requires the investigator to exercise critical thinking and verification of information at all levels of their application and follow institutional guidelines with respect to incorporated acceptable use, data privacy and publishing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="GenerativeAIServiceCatalog-GenerativeAI">Generative AI</h2>

<p><strong>Generative AI</strong>&nbsp;refers to AI models used to create new outputs using contextual information from a program or user. Common forms of generative AI include code, image &amp; video generators, as well as conversational chatbots. These models usually comprise of foundational models and tuning to label and interpret sets of data. Often, the models work to convert one medium of information into another, including but not limited to: converting a description into a new image, describing images to an end user, re-interpretation of text to specific bullet points, converting dialogue text into audio clips based on recorded voices, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Generative pre-trained transformers or GPTs</strong>&nbsp;rely on input tokens for transformation into a new medium of choice. When a machine learning model can translate between different mediums of communication, these models are referred to as&nbsp;<em>multi-modal AI.</em></p>

<p><strong>Large language models (LLMs)</strong>&nbsp;represent a class of artificial intelligence that focuses on natural language processing and providing relevant responses after analyzing bodies of text.</p>

<p>Existing models primarily use natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyze large amounts of text data from various sources, including the greater internet, libraries, archive centers and more. By doing so, they can uncover patterns and connections in bodies of text that may not be as easily accessible to a human researcher.</p>

<p>As infrastructure, artificial intelligence will enable automation of generative and interactive tasks, including software development, concierge services, text extraction and more. Enabling access to AI products and tools will be instrumental to effectively utilize public resources and reduce administrative overhead and delays.</p>
