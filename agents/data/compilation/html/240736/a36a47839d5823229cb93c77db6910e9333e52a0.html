				<li id="title02" style="font-size:20px"> Prerequisite Courses </li>

For many classes, a grade of “C” or better is required. Students are encouraged to consult their academic advisors regarding course prerequisites and proper course sequencing in the student’s selected fields of study.</li>



				<li> If a student enrolls in a class and does not meet the course prerequisite, they will be administratively dropped from the class. Refer to Administrative Drop on the <a href="../policies/registrationchanges.html"><u><b>Changes in Registration</b></u></a> page. Please note that the Administrative Drop Policy does not allow for tuition refunds.</li>
