												<p><b>December 16, 2025</b></p>

												<p>Dear ACCJC Member Faculty, Staff, Board Members, and Students, </p>
 
												<p>I am writing to share an update following today's meeting of the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI), the bipartisan advisory body appointed by Congress and the Administration to make recommendations to the U.S. Department of Education regarding the recognition of accrediting agencies.</p>
 
												<p>The meeting opened with the introduction of President Trump's six new members, and the election of one of those new members, Jay Greene, to serve as Chair of NACIQI. Dr. Greene is a Senior Research Fellow for the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation and will now lead the Committee's work.</p>
 
												<p>Following Dr. Greene's election, NACIQI heard remarks from Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent regarding the Administration's perspective on accreditation, including its perceived strengths, shortcomings, and the broader expectations for how higher education and quality assurance must evolve. </p>
 
												<p>The Department of Education shared the text of Under Secretary Kent's remarks as part of his presentation, and I am including that material with this message. I strongly encourage you to review the remarks to better understand the Administration's stated position on the future direction of accreditation and federal oversight.</p>
 
												<p>ACCJC will continue to work closely with our fellow accrediting agencies, our policy advisors at Penn Hill Group, and key federal stakeholders to advocate on behalf of our member institutions and-most importantly-our students. We have a scheduled meeting with Under Secretary Kent at the Department of Education on January 20, and we will continue to keep our community informed as these conversations progress.</p>
 
												<p>Thank you for your continued commitment to student learning, student outcomes, and continuous improvement. The Commission remains firmly aligned with the vital role of two-year institutions in providing high-quality, affordable, and workforce-aligned educational opportunities that support social mobility and economic opportunity for millions of students and their families.</p>
 
												<p>We appreciate your engagement and partnership as this important national conversation continues.</p>
 
												<p>Sincerely,</p>

												<p>Hello, </p>
 
												<p>In March of this year, we invited institutions to participate in ACCJC's Workforce Partnership Survey to gather institutional efforts in the attached preliminary draft paper celebrating and supporting workforce partnerships at ACCJC member institutions.</p>
 
												<p>This paper will be shared with higher education professionals, government officials, and the public as a tool to share how colleges like yours connect students to high-demand careers, build pathways into local industries, and support economic mobility. At this critical time, we believe it is important to share innovative practices and inform national policy conversations about the value of higher education.</p>
 
												<p>In addition to the paper, we will be providing readers with an accompanying list and brief on all workforce partnerships at our member institutions. This component is still in development as we've provided one last opportunity for those who have not participated to share a partnership brief. A final draft will be distributed to our members and used for ACCJC's national advocacy efforts in late July. Whether your institution is profiled within this paper, or included in the supplemental list, we thank you for sharing your story and bringing attention to your institution's efforts in expanding educational and employment opportunities for students.</p>
 
												<p>Sincerely, </p>
 
												<p>ACCJC</p>

												<p>Talofa ASCC Chiefs,</p>

												<p>Happy Tuesday! Attached is the approved ASCC Accreditation 2024-2025 Calendar. This calendar outlines the timeline for Accreditation tasks and action plans the College will address during the 2024-2025 fiscal year, in preparation for the 2028 Institutional Self-Evaluation Report (ISER).</p>

												<p>It also includes information on webinars and training sessions hosted but the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC). The 2024-2025 Accreditation Calendar will serve as a reference for both the College's 2028 ISER Action Plan and the institutional review of the College's Mission.</p>

													<li id="aug817"> <b> From ACCJC President Dr. Richard Winn: </b> </li>
													<li id="aug82017"> I am pleased to report that, on Monday, August 7, papers were filed in federal court confirming a settlement agreement in the legal actions filed by the California Federation of Teachers (CFT) and related litigants against ACCJC. This brings to a conclusion a lengthy period of tension between the two agencies. The settlement agreement acknowledges a number of changes in ACCJC operations, some of which were brought into focus by the lawsuit. The Commission has routinely made changes and will continue to make changes through its continuous self-improvement program that incorporates suggestions from ACCJC member colleges and educational leaders. The settlement agreement also notes that, in keeping with federal policy, ACCJC continues to preserve its autonomy in setting its policies and making accreditation decisions. The agreement also reflects a move toward resetting the relationships among the leadership of the agencies that anticipates collaboration toward shared goals in institutional quality improvement and increased student achievement. </li>
