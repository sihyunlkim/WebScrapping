				<p>	Welcome to the American Samoa Community College 2024-2026 Catalog! For over 50 years, ASCC 
					has pursued its Mission of fostering successful student learning by providing high quality educational
					programs and services through which students are able to achieve their educational goals and to contribute to
					the social, cultural, political, economic, technological, and environmental well-being of American Samoa. The
					contents of the 2024-2026 catalog reflects the diversity of educational opportunities offered by ASCC.
				</p>



				<p>
					As the educational needs of American Samoa evolve, ASCC strives to provide the Territory with the 
					instruction and/or training for today's educational and professional environments. The College has continued
					to address and further develop in the areas of high need and specialization with the aftermath of the pandemic.
					The territory and region were faced with the need for specialized skills and workforce certification in the
					content areas of information technology, professional trade skills, health care professions, and natural resource
					sustainability and research.

				</p>


				<p>
					ASCC provides a diversity of learning opportunities in professional areas, with the College's primary 
					focus as academics. In recent years, ASCC has joined the nationwide effort to promote the STEAM (Science,
					Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math) educational values and opened the STEAM Center housed within
					the Teacher Education Department. To address the territory and Pacific regional issues, the College has
					recently opened the Pacific Center for Human Security which ensures the accessibility of services and
					programs to diverse and often underserved populations within the territory and region. The Samoan Studies
					Institute has broadened its programs to now include certification in Samoan language instruction. With the
					region and world becoming dependent on technology, the College has opened new courses and programs in
					cybersecurity, homeland security, and information systems. The College plans to expand its course offerings
					to provide third- and fourth-year college level courses to broaden the course curricula and offer additional
					bachelor level programs in high needs areas which will add three new bachelor degree programs in addition to
					the bachelor degree program in Teacher Education.

				</p>


				<p>
					The American Samoa Government and private sector have worked collaboratively with the College 
					to secure agreements in workforce development and skill building through certification, training, and resource
					planning. As the College continues to receive support from federal, local, and organizational sources, the
					academic programs are strengthened and inclusive of the needs of the territory. As you view this new edition
					of our Catalog, we hope you will find your personal area of interest among the many educational options we
					offer!
