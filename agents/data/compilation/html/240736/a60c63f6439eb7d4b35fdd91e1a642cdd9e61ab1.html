				<p>Pursuant to Section 99.7 of the rules and regulations governing the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act of 1974 (hereinafter the Act), students in attendance at the American Samoa Community College are hereby notified of the following: </p>

						

				<ul class="list-inside">

					<li> It is the policy of the American Samoa Community College to subscribe to the requirements of Section 438 of the General Education Provision Act, Title IV, of the Public Law 90-247, as amended, and to rules and regulations governing the Act, which protect the privacy rights of students. </li>

					<li> The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their educational records. They are: 

						<ul>

							<li>The right to inspect and review the student’s education records within 45 days of the day the College receives a request for access. Students should submit to the Registrar, Dean, or other appropriate officials, written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The College official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the college officials to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.</li>

							<li>The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes is inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask the College to amend the record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write to the College official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want to change, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the College decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the College will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his/her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.</li>

							<li>The right to consent to disclosures of personal identifiable information contained in the student’s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to College officials with legitimate educational interests. A College official is a person employed by the College in an administrative, supervisory, academic research, or support staff position; a person or company with whom the College has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another College official in performing his/her tasks. A College official has legitimate interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his/her professional responsibility.</li>

						</ul>

					</li>

					<li>The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by a State College to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA are: Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence Avenue S.W., Washington, D.C. 20202-4605.</li>

					<li>Students are advised that certain personally identifiable information listed below is considered by the College to be directory information and, in response to public inquiry, may be disclosed in conformance with federal law, at the College’s discretion, without prior consent of the students unless the student otherwise so informs the College not to disclose such information:

						<ul>

							<li>Name of Student</li>

							<li>Address of Student</li>

							<li>Telephone Number</li>

							<li>Email Address</li>

							<li>Major Field of Study</li>

							<li>Dates of Enrollment</li>

							<li>Enrollment Status (full time, part time, etc.)</li>

							<li>Degrees, Academic Honors, and Awards received</li>

							<li>Student Status (new, continuing, returning)</li>

						</ul>

					</li>

				</ul>			

				



				<p>A student has the right to request that any or all of the above items not be designated directory information with the respect to that student. Should a student wish to exercise this right, he/she must present in person and in writing a request, no earlier than the first day of instruction and no later than 14 (fourteen) calendar days from the first day of instruction for the academic term or semester, or the fourth day of a summer session.</p>

				<p>A parent, spouse, sibling, or any other relative of a student is advised that information contained in educational records, except as may be determined to be directory information, will not be disclosed to him/her without the prior written consent of the student. This includes, but is not limited to, the release of the student transcript. Please refer to the <a href="../studentservices/transcripts.html">transcripts</a> section for more information.</p>
