It mimics natural language by identifying and producing the next most likely word or string of words in response to a given prompt. The material used to train the tool&rsquo;s algorithm included a selection of publicly available content on the internet up to 2021 and is only capable of creating responses to prompts based on the data used in its training. As a result, ChatGPT cannot address current events, accurately serve as a style or grammar guide, reference specific quotes or elements of texts that were not part of its training, or be trusted to supply factually accurate and unbiased information in its current state (<a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/resources/chatgpt/" rel="noreferrer noopener" style="color:#0c5449; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">CITL UC Santa Cruz</a>, <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/education/educational-development-training/knowledge-dossier/what-is-chatgpt-capable-of-and-what-are-its-limitations" rel="noreferrer noopener" style="color:#0c5449; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Utrecht University</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/03/03/the-top-10-limitations-of-chatgpt/?sh=30bf45f58f35" rel="noreferrer noopener" style="color:#0c5449; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Forbes</a>).   </p>    <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px; margin-bottom:16px; margin-top:16px">While recent advances in AI hold exciting potential, some instructors have raised questions about how their students might use these tools. We dug into higher education publications and invited individuals on campus to share their thoughts and experiences on how to become curious about these new technologies and integrate AI in the classroom as learning experiences. </p>    <h2 style="line-height:1.3">Turning AI technologies into learning opportunities </h2>    <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px; margin-bottom:16px; margin-top:16px">WSU instructors and staff agree on the need to find strategies to minimize the likelihood of students using AI tools like ChatGPT without explicit instructor permission. <a href="https://doso.wayne.edu/contact/directory" rel="noreferrer noopener" style="color:#0c5449; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Nikolina Dmitruchina</a>, associate director and student conduct officer in the Dean of Students Office, is responsible for cases of academic misconduct. She and her team have not come across any cases yet in which students have submitted text created by AI as their own work.  </p>    <h3 style="line-height:1.3">Talk with your students </h3>    <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px; margin-bottom:16px; margin-top:16px">While there are concerns about students misusing AI for assignments due to grade anxiety or being in a time-crunch due to multiple competing deadlines, Nikolina recommends that instructors talk with their students about the importance of academic integrity, not only for the specific class they are taking but also in terms of what it means for students&rsquo; future careers and self-integrity. Talking with students is a sentiment also shared by <a href="https://clasprofiles.wayne.edu/profile/ar6561" rel="noreferrer noopener" style="color:#0c5449; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Aaron Retish</a>, professor of Russian history. He suggests having &ldquo;honest conversations with students about chatbots. I have done that in my classes this term and found students to be more critical and even dismissive of AI results than me.&rdquo;  </p>    <h3 style="line-height:1.3">Have we been here before? </h3>    <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px; margin-bottom:16px; margin-top:16px">The emergence of AI technology shares similarities with other technical developments in the past that instructors have addressed successfully. Aaron notes further that the concept of AI is not new and that WSU instructors are well equipped to deal with its impacts: &ldquo;We are coming out of the most innovative period of teaching in the history of Wayne State. During lockdown, most of us reimagined how we teach. Teaching remotely meant rethinking assignments to discourage plagiarism and encourage critical thinking.&rdquo; </p>    <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px; margin-bottom:16px; margin-top:16px">Other institutions have recently compared AI to the emergence of Wikipedia (<a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/news/chatgpt-guidance-cuny-classroom?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=the graduate center, city university of new york" rel="noreferrer noopener" style="color:#0c5449; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">CUNY Graduate Center</a>). Instructors were worried that students would lose the ability to conduct original research or critique the accuracy of information presented to them. Now we have incorporated strategies to teach students how to use it as a tool instead of a means to an end. </p>    <h3 style="line-height:1.3">Learn with AI </h3>    <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px; margin-bottom:16px; margin-top:16px">We also encountered excitement about the potential learning that can occur when AI is integrated into lessons and projects to prepare for the reality of how artificial intelligence is used in the workplace. For example, <a href="https://ilitchbusiness.wayne.edu/profile/fe4354" rel="noreferrer noopener" style="color:#0c5449; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Deborah Habel</a>, associate professor of teaching - accounting, conducted a demo with her Accounting Information Systems students to illustrate the real-life implications AI has on both accounting as well as cyber security. In a similar fashion, <a href="https://ilitchbusiness.wayne.edu/profile/ai2824" rel="noreferrer noopener" style="color:#0c5449; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">John Heinrichs</a>, associate professor of information systems management, uses <a href="https://www.jasper.ai/" rel="noreferrer noopener" style="color:#0c5449; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Jasper AI</a> with his students to prepare them for future work applications of writing content for social media marketing, email marketing and advertising with the help of artificial intelligence.  </p>    <h2 style="line-height:1.3">Some suggestions for engaging students and designing assignments </h2>    <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px; margin-bottom:16px; margin-top:16px">Aaron Retish has established practices that have worked with his students. He recommends the following: </p>    <ul style="margin-bottom:16px; margin-top:16px">  	<li style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px">&ldquo;Teach with the students in mind. Most students want to learn. Focusing on building students&rsquo; writing and thinking skills and self-confidence are critical, as is creating a trusting relationship in the classroom.&rdquo;</li>  	<li style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px">&ldquo;Have fun with AI! Have the students use ChatGPT to complete a short prompt in the classroom and unpack the deficiencies of the AI product.&rdquo; </li>  </ul>    <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px; margin-bottom:16px; margin-top:16px">Other strategies for designing assignments include these summarized recommendations from &quot;<a href="https://cndls.georgetown.edu/ai-composition-tools/" rel="noreferrer noopener" style="color:#0c5449; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">ChatGPT and AI Composition Tools</a>&quot; by Georgetown University&#39;s Center for New Design and Learning in Scholarship: </p>    <ul style="margin-bottom:16px; margin-top:16px">  	<li style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px">Design writing prompts that require students to reference material unique to your class (including discussion boards, specific readings, etc.). The AI struggles with prompts that refer to specific external objects or require synthesis and analysis of texts. Consider how <a href="https://canvas.wayne.edu/courses/125324/pages/aligning-assignments-and-exams-with-learning-outcomes" rel="noreferrer noopener" style="color:#0c5449; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">authentic assessments</a>* could benefit your students and reduce the effectiveness of an AI text generator.</li>  	<li style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px">Include the development process in the final grade and not just a final product. <a href="https://canvas.wayne.edu/courses/125324/pages/scaffolding-your-lesson" rel="noreferrer noopener" style="color:#0c5449; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Scaffolding</a>* writing prompts makes ChatGPT less helpful. Ask students to work in steps, reflect on various stages, and provide an explanation of how they created or otherwise determined their next iteration and final product.</li>  	<li style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px">Incorporate peer review or have students include responding to their peers as part of the assignment.</li>  	<li style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px">Ask students to include and cite outside sources.</li>  	<li style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px">Test your own assignment prompts in ChatGPT first and see what you get. Revise your prompt to be more specific if the AI is able to answer it successfully. </li>  </ul>    <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px; margin-bottom:16px; margin-top:16px">If you don&rsquo;t see ways to incorporate this technology into your teaching, don&rsquo;t feel pressured to do so. These suggestions might not be applicable for every class, since teaching needs differ based on discipline, your curriculum, and the types of assignments you give.  </p>    <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:24px; margin-bottom:16px; margin-top:16px">For more information on best practices and recent developments, visit the <a href="https://canvas.wayne.edu/courses/125324/pages/artificial-intelligence-in-teaching-and-learning" rel="noreferrer noopener" style="color:#0c5449; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">AI in Teaching and Learning</a>* page in the OTL&rsquo;s Virtual Resource Hub.
