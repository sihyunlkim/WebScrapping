        <p class='noWrapClass'><strong>Policy Summary/Purpose:</strong> <br />

	This policy articulates an enterprise-wide commitment to information<br />

	security and sets standards for how confidential information maintained<br />

	by the University of Mississippi (UM) is to be protected. The purpose of<br />

	this policy is to ensure that UM employees at all levels, as well as<br />

	contractors, understand their roles and responsibilities in reducing<br />

	institutional risk as related to information security. Access to sensitive<br />

	information is subject to policies, guidelines, and procedures that are<br />

	set by UM, the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning (IHL), and the<br />

	Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services (MS-DITS), as<br />

	well as federal and state laws. Adequately securing customer information<br />

	is not only the law but also good business sense. Poorly managed customer<br />

	data opens doors to identity theft and provides access to sensitive<br />

	information that could result in loss to customers.<br />
