<p>Academic integrity is essential for an academic community, including UC San Diego. Academic integrity is built on a foundation of honest, responsible, fair and trustworthy scholarly activity.<a name="_ednref1" href="#_edn1">[i]</a> Without it, the degrees we confer, the research we conduct, and our reputation all diminish in value.</p>
<p>Thus, the University expects that both faculty and students will adhere to its standards of academic integrity. The UC San Diego Academic Integrity Policy (herein the “Policy”) states the general rules associated with student integrity of scholarship. The Procedures for Resolving Alleged Violations of the Policy (herein the “Procedures”) are found at: <a href="/media/633239/ai-procedures.pdf" target="_blank" title="/media/633239/ai-procedures.pdf">/media/633239/ai-procedures.pdf</a> and authorized by the San Diego Division of the Academic Senate’s Educational Policy Committee. <br />The Policy applies to all persons:<br />• matriculated at UC San Diego as undergraduate or graduate students<br />• enrolled as students in UC San Diego undergraduate or graduate courses</p>
<p>Medical students are governed by policies specified in the Handbook for School of Medicine Advisors and Students, as formulated by the School of Medicine Committee on Educational Policy. Pharmacy students are governed by the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences (SSPPS) Policy on Integrity of Scholarship as formulated by the SSPPS faculty. A separate policy exists governing integrity of research.</p>

</div>
</div></div></li><li class="clause"><div class="clauseIndex">C)</div><div class="clauseBody"><p><strong>Instructional Assistants’ (IA) Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>A student acting in the capacity of an instructional assistant (IA), a category including but not limited to teaching assistants, readers, and tutors, has a special responsibility to safeguard academic integrity and report suspected violations to the instructor. In this role the student functions as an apprentice instructor, under the tutelage of the responsible instructor. An IA shall equitably grade student work in the manner agreed upon with the course instructor. An IA shall not provide any student with any information or collaboration that would aid the student in completing the course in a dishonest manner (e.g., providing access to unauthorized material related to assessments). An IA who violates these responsibilities may be subject to discipline under this Policy but also under employee policies.<sup><sup><br /></sup></sup></p></div></li></ul></div></li><li class="clause"><div class="clauseIndex">II)</div><div class="clauseBody"><p><strong>Roles and Responsibilities for Resolving Academic Integrity Violations<br /></strong><br />The responsibility for resolving academic integrity violations rests with two University authorities: the faculty and the administration. Under the Standing Order of the Regents, authority over courses and curricula is delegated to the faculty through the Academic Senate. The University of California’s Policy on Student Conduct and Discipline authorizes the UC San Diego administration to discipline students for academic misconduct (which are referred to as academic integrity violations in this Policy). Cases in which the student accepts or is found responsible for academic integrity violations will normally result in consequences, including but not limited to, academic integrity training, an academic sanction, and administrative sanction(s).</p><ul><li class="clause"><div class="clauseIndex">A)</div><div class="clauseBody"><strong>Academic Responsibilities</strong>  <br />
<p>The instructor shall report all suspected academic integrity violations to the Academic Integrity Office (AIO), shall participate in the process according to this Policy and the corresponding Procedures, and, when the case is resolved, shall determine the academic sanction (the student’s grade in the course). Any violation of this Policy by the student may be considered grounds for failure in the course, although lesser consequences may be incurred in less serious circumstances. An instructor shall not assign an academic sanction for an academic integrity violation unless they have submitted an Allegation Report<a name="_ednref1" href="#_edn1" title="">[i]</a> to the AIO and there is an acceptance or final finding of responsibility. If the course concludes before a resolution is reached, the instructor will assign an “X” code for the course.</p>
<p>An instructor may withdraw an academic integrity allegation if they determine they have insufficient evidence to proceed and/or no longer suspect a violation occurred. An instructor cannot withdraw a charge if a student has already accepted responsibility or has been found responsible for an academic integrity violation. It is recommended that Instructors consult with the AI Office before withdrawing an allegation.</p>
<p>In cases where an academic integrity violation is reported in independent exams (exams held outside of coursework), such as placement exams and qualifying exams, or culminating academic work, such as undergraduate or graduate theses, dissertations, and independent study projects, the academic sanction will be determined by the faculty member or by the faculty committee that maintains ultimate responsibility for evaluating the exam or work. The sanction will establish both of the following:</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 1.5em;">
<li>Evaluation of the exam results or work. This may include granting a student full, partial, or no credit.</li>
<li>Provision to allow or deny a student the ability to repeat the exam or resubmit the culminating work.</li>
</ol>
<div><br />
<div id="edn1" class="hr">
<p><a name="_edn1" href="#_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> See the corresponding Procedures.</p>
</div>
</div></div></li><li class="clause"><div class="clauseIndex">B)</div><div class="clauseBody"><strong>Administrative Responsibilities</strong>
<p>There are many different administrators who have roles in the process of resolving academic integrity violations; in this Policy and the corresponding Procedures, they are all referred to as the Appropriate Administrative Authority (AAA). The responsibilities and title designations of the AAAs are as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">• <strong>Decision and Resolution Phase</strong>: the Resolution AAA may be an AIO staff member, a college Dean of Student Affairs or their designee, or the Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs (GEPA) Assistant Dean of Student Affairs or their designee.<br />• <strong>Sanctioning Phase:</strong> the Resolution AAA imposes administrative sanctions unless the sanction is: (1) Suspension (not deferred), (2) Dismissal, or (3) there is any deviation from the Sanctioning Guidelines; in that case, the Resolution AAA presents the proposed sanction to the Sanctioning Body (comprised of the Council of Deans of Student Affairs, and the GEPA Assistant Dean when the case involves a graduate student), which must approve the sanction.<br />• <strong>Appeal Phase</strong>: the Appeal AAA is the student’s college Provost (undergraduates), the Chair of the Council of Provosts (summer session and extension), or the GEPA Dean (graduate students). The Appeal AAA presents the appeal to the Appellate Body (comprised of the Council of Provosts for undergraduates, summer session and extension students, and the GEPA Dean when the case involves a graduate student) for a decision.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">If students from two or more different units (e.g., colleges, Summer Session, Extension, or the Graduate Division) are allegedly involved in the same incident, one Resolution AAA will normally resolve all of the allegations.</p>
<p>The Resolution AAA will impose Administrative Sanctions in accordance with guidelines authorized by the Educational Policy Committee. Administrative sanctions range in severity, but can be applied only when a student has accepted responsibility or has been held responsible.<a name="_ednref1" href="#_edn1" title="">[i]</a> Students with multiple confirmed academic integrity violations shall be subject to dismissal from the University.<br /><br />Decisions by the Appellate Body are final.</p>

<p>The AIO is the administrative manager for this Policy and for the processing of reported academic integrity violations, and the coordinator of the AI review and appeal process. The AIO may gather the materials necessary to fully document suspected academic integrity violations, resolve allegations as an AAA, and advise faculty and students throughout the process. The AIO oversees training of all persons serving as AAAs, Academic Integrity Review Board panelists and Presiding Officers, Review Advisors, A.S. Student Advocates, Instructors conducting Instructor-Student Resolution Meetings, and any others who are routinely involved the process for resolving academic integrity violation allegations. The AIO may extend any timelines in the Procedures when practical exigencies so dictate, in which case all involved parties will normally be notified in writing. The AIO shall maintain a record of all cases and shall report annually to the Educational Policy Committee on the number, nature, and type of cases; the pattern of decision-making; the severity and type of academic and administrative sanctions; and other relevant matters. The AIO is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the procedures that accompany this Policy and chairs the committee that reviews and updates the procedures on an annual or bi-annual basis.
