<h2 id="course-content-and-objectives">Course Content and Objectives</h2>
<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is the study of intelligent behavior of machines. Broadly speaking, this is understanding how to make machines and software that can reason, learn, and evolve like animals or humans.</p>

<p>AI has a long and interesting history that arose out of philosophical questions from antiquity and blossomed in the 1950s with the advent of electronic computers and computational research. In this course, we will study the basic ideas behind automated reasoning, heuristic search, representing knowledge effectively, and learning.</p>

<p>The course is structured in 15 lessons, listed below. Each lesson will have a set of learning objectives, required reading, and possibly a related lab or written assignment.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lesson 1: Introduction</li>
<li>Lesson 2: Agents</li>
<li>Lesson 3: Uninformed Search</li>
<li>Lesson 4: Informed Search</li>
<li>Lesson 5: Local Search</li>
<li>Lesson 6: Evolutionary Computation</li>
<li>Lesson 7: Adversarial Search and Games</li>
<li>Lesson 8: Constraint Satisfaction</li>
<li>Lesson 9: Propositional Satisfiability</li>
<li>Lesson 10: Logical Agents, Propositional Logic</li>
<li>Lesson 11: First-order Logic</li>
<li>Lesson 12: Inductive Learning and Decision Trees</li>
<li>Lesson 13: Linear Models and Nearest Neighbors</li>

</ol>
<h2 id="assignments-and-grading">Assignments and Grading</h2>
<!-- XXX -->
<h3 id="assignments">Projects and Homework</h3>
<p>There will be approximately five lab projects and five written homework assignments worth <b><font color="red">20 points each</font></b>. The labs are programming exercises where we will build concrete instances of algorithms discussed in class. We will use <a href="http://www.python.org">python</a> for every programming exercise. No prior experience with python is necessary.</p>
<p>All assignments must be submitted by their stated due date.</p>
<h3>Students enrolled in 5222</h3>
<p>If you are a graduate student enrolled in 5222, there will be an extra research project where you will select a current AI topic, collect and read relevant publications, and give a short (~15 minute) oral presentation at the end of the semester.
  </p>
<h3>Participation</h3>
<p>This is an upper division course, and therefore I will not make attendance mandatory. However, classroom participation will be graded and included as part of the assignment component for the computation of the final grades. To allow a fair chance for everyone to participate, I will sometimes draw names at random to ask questions about the material. If you are called on, you have the opportunity to earn one of three scores: 2 (strong answer), 1 (satisfactory or reasonable attempt), 0 (unsatisfactory). Don't be afraid of wrong answers: they are actually helpful to the learning process.</p>
<p>At the end of the semester, your participation grade will be computed by taking your total participation score and dividing by the number of times you were called on. This ratio will then be multiplied by the total number of points allotted for participation.</p>
<h3 id="examinations">Examinations</h3>
<p>There will be two midterm exams, worth <b><font color="red">100 points each</font></b> and a final exam worth <b><font color="red">200 points</font></b>. Both exams are closed book, and the final exam will be comprehensive. Exams will <i>not</i> be given early, and makeups must be justified by dire circumstances described to the instructor <i>before</i> the time of the exam. It is Department of Computer Science policy not to return final exams, however they are kept and you can look at your exam in the instructor's office. The UMD <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/vcaa/FinalExams.html"> Final Examination Policy</a> web page explains the UMD policy about having more than two final exams on a single day, among other things.</p>

<h2 id="policies">Academic Policies</h2>
<p><strong>Student Conduct Code:<br /></strong> Appropriate classroom conduct promotes an environment of academic achievement and integrity. Disruptive classroom behavior that substantially or repeatedly interrupts either the instructor's ability to teach, or student learning, is prohibited. Student are expected adhere to the Board of Regents Policy: <a href="https://regents.umn.edu/sites/regents.umn.edu/files/policies/Student_Conduct_Code.pdf">https://regents.umn.edu/sites/regents.umn.edu/files/policies/Student_Conduct_Code.pdf</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching &amp; Learning: Instructor and Student Responsibilities:<br /></strong> UMD is committed to providing a positive, safe, and inclusive place for all who study and work here. Instructors and students have mutual responsibility to insure that the environment in all of these settings supports teaching and learning, is respectful of the rights and freedoms of all members, and promotes a civil and open exchange of ideas. Reference the full policy here: <a href="http://d.umn.edu/academic-affairs/academic-policies/classroom-policies/instructor-and-student-responsibilities">http://d.umn.edu/academic-affairs/academic-policies/classroom-policies/instructor-and-student-responsibilities</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Integrity:<br /></strong> Academic dishonesty is taken seriously by the University. Cheating on assignments or examinations, plagiarizing, or any other act which violates the rights of another student in academic work or that involves misrepresentation of your own work may result in a grade reduction on the assignment/quiz/test or a grade reduction in the class (including the possibility of failing the class). If a student is found responsible for academic dishonesty, a report is filed with the UMD student academic integrity officer and is considered a violation of the Student Conduct Code. The UMD Student Academic Integrity Policy can be found at <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/academic-affairs/academic-policies/classroom-policies/student-academic-integrity">http://www.d.umn.edu/academic-affairs/academic-policies/classroom-policies/student-academic-integrity</a>. The policy outlines what is considered prohibited conduct.</p>
<p><strong>Final Exams:<br /></strong> All 1xxx-5xxx courses offered for undergraduate credit should include a final graded component or end of term evaluation that assesses the level of student achievement of one or more course objectives. All final graded components are to be administered or due at the time and place according to the final exam schedule and not during the last week of class. Reference the full policy here: <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/vcaa/FinalExams.html">http://www.d.umn.edu/vcaa/FinalExams.html</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Excused Absences:<br /></strong>Students are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings. It is the responsibility of students to plan their schedules to avoid excessive conflict with course requirements. However, there are legitimate and verifiable circumstances that lead to excused student absence from the classroom. These are subpoenas, jury duty, military duty, religious observances, illness, bereavement for immediate family, and NCAA varsity intercollegiate athletics. Find complete information here: <a href="http://d.umn.edu/academic-affairs/academic-policies/classroom-policies/excused-absences">http://d.umn.edu/academic-affairs/academic-policies/classroom-policies/excused-absences</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appropriate Student Use of Class Notes and Course Materials:<br /></strong> Taking notes is a means of recording information but more importantly of personally absorbing and integrating the educational experience. However, broadly disseminating class notes beyond the classroom community or accepting compensation for taking and distributing classroom notes undermines instructor interests in their intellectual work product while not substantially furthering instructor and student interests in effective learning. Find additional information here: <a href="http://d.umn.edu/academic-affairs/academic-policies/classroom-policies/course-notes-and-materials">http://d.umn.edu/academic-affairs/academic-policies/classroom-policies/course-notes-and-materials</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Students with Disabilities<br /></strong> It is the policy and practice of the University of Minnesota Duluth to create inclusive learning environments for all students, including students with disabilities. If there are aspects of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion or your ability to meet course requirements such as time limited exams, inaccessible web content, or the use of non-captioned videos, please notify the instructor as soon as possible. You are also encouraged to contact the Office of Disability Resources to discuss and arrange reasonable accommodations. Call <a target="_blank">218-726-6130</a> or visit the Disability Resources web site at <a href="https://umd-general.umn.edu/disability-resources">https://umd-general.umn.edu/disability-resources</a> for more information.</p>
