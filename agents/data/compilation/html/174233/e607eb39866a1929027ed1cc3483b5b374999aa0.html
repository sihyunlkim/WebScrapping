<meta property="og:description" content="Rebecca Ropers, PhD, has been named executive vice chancellor and provost (EVC/provost) at the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD). She has been serving in the interim role since July 1 of last year.“In the past year on this campus, Dr. Ropers has proven to be a thoughtful leader with tremendous dedication to this community of scholars and educators,” UMD Chancellor Charles T. Nies, PhD, said. “I’m thrilled that she will continue to share her talents, insights, and curiosity with us into the future.” As EVC/provost, Dr. Ropers serves as the chief academic officer for the campus and senior advisor to the chancellor. Provost Ropers will provide visionary leadership for academic programs and procedures while collaboratively fostering a culture of excellence and innovation, connection and curiosity.“I am honored to serve as UMD’s executive vice chancellor and provost. In the past year, I have witnessed the commitment of faculty, staff, students, and community members who have invested in our transformational work. I am excited to become a more permanent part of this community and am grateful to those who have helped me learn about the people, programs, and possibilities of this extraordinary campus,“ Ropers said. “Together, we will advance our research, teaching, and service missions and deepen UMD’s impact in students’ lives and our broader communities.”Dr. Ropers has been a scholar and educational leader for nearly three decades, first at Louisiana State University and for the last 18 years at the University of Minnesota. Beginning with her PhD at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, she has prioritized faculty development and organizational change to facilitate inclusive and engaged communities. She has held many leadership roles, including department chair, chair of the faculty governance executive body, and vice provost for faculty and academic affairs. Before joining UMD, she served as the senior advisor for academic leadership and conflict resolution on the Twin Cities campus.The EVC/provost is a key member of the university’s senior leadership team and is responsible for overseeing the Office of Academic Affairs, which facilitates the success of students, faculty, and staff by providing a supportive framework for a vibrant campus community that advances teaching, learning, research, and creative expression.Ropers’ appointment will begin upon approval by the University of Minnesota Board of Regents.Header Image: Provost Ropers welcomes attendees at UMD&#039;s 2025 Commencement Ceremonies while in her interim role as Interim Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs.

<p>As EVC/provost, Dr. Ropers serves as the chief academic officer for the campus and senior advisor to the chancellor. Provost Ropers will provide visionary leadership for academic programs and procedures while collaboratively fostering a culture of excellence and innovation, connection and curiosity.</p><p>“I am honored to serve as UMD’s executive vice chancellor and provost. In the past year, I have witnessed the commitment of faculty, staff, students, and community members who have invested in our transformational work. I am excited to become a more permanent part of this community and am grateful to those who have helped me learn about the people, programs, and possibilities of this extraordinary campus,“ Ropers said. “Together, we will advance our research, teaching, and service missions and deepen UMD’s impact in students’ lives and our broader communities.”</p><p>Dr. Ropers has been a scholar and educational leader for nearly three decades, first at Louisiana State University and for the last 18 years at the University of Minnesota. Beginning with her PhD at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, she has prioritized faculty development and organizational change to facilitate inclusive and engaged communities. She has held many leadership roles, including department chair, chair of the faculty governance executive body, and vice provost for faculty and academic affairs. Before joining UMD, she served as the senior advisor for academic leadership and conflict resolution on the Twin Cities campus.</p><p>The EVC/provost is a key member of the university’s senior leadership team and is responsible for overseeing the <a href="https://evcaa.d.umn.edu/">Office of Academic Affairs</a>, which facilitates the success of students, faculty, and staff by providing a supportive framework for a vibrant campus community that advances teaching, learning, research, and creative expression.</p><p>Ropers’ appointment will begin upon approval by the University of Minnesota Board of Regents.</p><p class="photo-credit">Header Image: Provost Ropers welcomes attendees at UMD's 2025 Commencement Ceremonies while in her interim role as Interim Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs.
