<p>The Division of Education attempts to share changes in policy, procedures, and protocols well in advance. Modifications or regulations may be imposed by other external sources. The Division of Education reserves the right to immediately change program requirements without prior notice.  Education candidates seeking Ohio licensure must apply for Teacher Preparation and meet requirements in the designated sequence.</p>
<h2 class="SubHeading">Transition Points in the Teacher Preparation Program</h2>
<p>Education licensure candidates should be familiar with the five major transition points in the Teacher Preparation Program. The first occurs during successful completion of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=EDUC%20107" title="EDUC 107" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'EDUC 107');">EDUC 107</a></span> School and Society; the second during the sophomore year when students are officially accepted into the program; the third occurs during the junior year when students are accepted into the pre-clinical/clinical practice program and become candidates; the fourth is exit from the clinical practice semester; the fifth follows candidates’ progress after graduation and into their first years of teaching, continuing to assess candidate satisfaction through the use of surveys for program follow-up. </p>

<p>Data are collected at each point to measure program effectiveness and to determine improvements to the curriculum thus ensuring each teacher candidate adequately meets the minimum standard for seven candidate proficiencies.  Assessments of the proficiencies affirm the unit’s expectation that candidates will:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Demonstrate knowledge of student learning and development and respect in the diversity of the students they teach.</li>
	<li>Apply knowledge in the areas for which they have instructional responsibility.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate knowledge on the use of varied assessments to inform instruction, evaluate, and ensure student learning.</li>
	<li>Plan and deliver effective instruction that advances the learning of each individual student.</li>
	<li>Create learning environments that promote high levels of learning and achievement for all students.</li>
	<li>Collaborate and communicate with other educators, administrators, students, parents, and the community to support student learning.</li>
	<li>Assume responsibility for professional growth, performance, and involvement as an individual and as a member of a learning community.</li>
</ol>
<p>Candidates should be aware of deadlines and program requirements for each transition point and should work closely with their advisors to ensure all pre-conditions are met in a timely basis.  More detailed information about the transition points in the Teacher Preparation Program can be found in the Division of Education’s Student Handbook.</p>
<h3 class="SubHeading">Transition Point #1:  EDUC 107 school and society course</h3>
<p>The Division of Education Handbook is reviewed in this course. Candidates will review the Ohio Department of Education (ODE) guidelines for licensure eligibility and sign the ODE Office of Professional Conduct’s <em>Good Moral Character Statement of Assurance</em>.</p>
<p>Candidates must successfully complete the introductory course with a B- or better.  This includes successful completion of the required field experience.  The candidate must also receive an acceptable score on the Disposition Rubric.  <span>Division of Education policy states a candidate may take EDUC 107 </span><u>no more than two times to achieve the B- or better course grade. </u></p>
<p>Candidates are responsible for the payment and completion of the BCI&amp;I and FBI fingerprinting at the beginning of the course semester.  Results must comply with the Ohio Department of Education licensure eligibility requirements.</p>
<p>DOE Student Undergraduate Handbook Signature Page Signed by Candidate signifying he/she read and understands policies and procedures of the Division of Education.  </p>
<h3 class="BodyTextNS">Transition Point #2:  Entry into TEACHER PREPARATION</h3>
<p>Candidates pursuing licensure must be formally accepted into the Teacher Preparation Program.  Transition point #2 for students usually occurs during the second semester of their sophomore year or after the completion of the four core Education courses.  Acceptance into the program is a prerequisite for enrollment in higher-level (300 and 400) Education courses, including pre-clinical/clinical practice.  The deadline for application to the Teacher Preparation Program is the third Friday of each semester/session:  Fall, Spring, Summer I, and Summer III in which requirements will be completed.  Applications and other related materials for the Teacher Preparation Program are available in the Division of Education Licensure Office. The deadlines for submission are clearly stated. </p>
