<meta name="description" content="This qualitative case study examined how sixth–12th grade educators at a single-gender public school in West Texas perceived the role of generative AI in reducing workload, minimizing stress, and supporting professional autonomy. The study focused on concerns related to teacher burnout and the time demands of instructional and noninstructional responsibilities, exploring how emerging technologies might offer practical relief. The study aimed to understand how educators use generative AI tools and identify both the benefits and challenges associated with their integration. Framed by job demand-resource theory, connectivism, and heutagogy, the research explored how generative AI can function as a job resource, support networked learning, and foster teacher-driven adaptation. Using a qualitative case study design, data were collected through semistructured interviews with six full-time teachers of grades 6–12. Participants taught in various content areas and held a range of teaching experience. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Braun and Clarke’s six-phase framework for thematic analysis. MAXQDA was used to support coding and identify key themes. Teachers described using AI tools such as ChatGPT, MagicSchool AI, Grammarly, and Quizizz to streamline lesson planning, build rubrics, generate quizzes, and improve email communication. Those using AI consistently reported saving between 5 and 7 hours per week on routine tasks. The findings suggest that AI tools may help create more sustainable teaching conditions when supported by professional development and equitable access. This study contributes to ongoing discussions about educational technology by centering teachers’ voices and highlighting the practical conditions necessary for responsible and meaningful implementation in K–12 settings.">

Framed by job demand-resource theory, connectivism, and heutagogy, the research explored how generative AI can function as a job resource, support networked learning, and foster teacher-driven adaptation. Using a qualitative case study design, data were collected through semistructured interviews with six full-time teachers of grades 6–12.
