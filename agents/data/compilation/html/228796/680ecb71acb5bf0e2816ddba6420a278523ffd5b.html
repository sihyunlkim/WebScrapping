<h3 class="toggle">Enrollment Services Center</h3>
<p>The Enrollment Services Center endeavors to support UTEP’s mission of universal access and excellence by providing communication and outreach services to students, prospective students, and service/academic units on campus through the administration of the university’s Constituent Relationship Management system, texting and chat software, and outbound calling campaign services. The ESC provides support for prospective and currently enrolled students in admissions applications, financial aid applications, course registration, UTEP account activation, and many other services. The Constituent Relationship Management System (CRM), under the management of Strategic Enrollment System (SES) the ESC collaborates with SES to facilitate the delivery of relevant, timely, and actionable information by allowing for the design of efficient and effective communication strategies tailored to specific constituent needs. Through various methods of communication, including inquiry pages, emails, and event, case, and application management, the CRM is a powerful tool to increase success in new student enrollment, first-year retention, persistence, and completion.  </p>
<h3 class="toggle">Entering Student Program/University Studies</h3>
<p>The Entering Student Program (ESP) focuses on assisting entering first-year and transfer students with successfully transitioning to The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). To help students develop their UTEP Edge, ESP offers several opportunities to participate in Edge High-Impact Practices (HIPs). The first HIP is UNIV 1301 Seminar in Critical Inquiry, a core curriculum course in UTEP’s Component Area Option. ESP teaches UNIV 1301 sections designated for first-year students with fewer than 30 semester credit hours and also offers UNIV 1301 sections for transfer students who are in their first or second semester at UTEP and who have earned 30 or more semester credit hours. ESP also offers learning communities (linked courses), a second Edge HIP, to help students make academic and social connections in their first year at UTEP. Another key component of ESP is the peer leader program, which prepares and supports students who serve as members of the instructional team for UNIV courses. Peer leaders work in the classroom as on-campus student employees, a third UTEP Edge HIP.</p>
<p>In the summer, ESP administers UTEP Prep, a summer bridge program designed to help first-year students transition from high school to UTEP during the summer following their high school graduation. In UTEP Prep, students learn to use campus resources and become engaged university students while enrolled in 2 required courses taught in a 6-week summer term. To learn more about UTEP Prep, please visit (<a href="https://www.utep.edu/utepprep/">https://www.utep.edu/utepprep/</a>).</p>

<h4>University Course</h4>
<p>University 1301 Seminar for Critical Inquiry is a 3-credit hour core curriculum course created to help students make a successful start at UTEP. Entering students will build on their talents, skills, and experiences in UNIV 1301 to successfully transition to the University. This course is designed to engage students intellectually in a specific academic topic, which will further develop their knowledge and skills, as well as their connection with the UTEP community. Students should read the description for each UNIV 1301, and then register for the section with a theme that interests them. Although the themes vary from section to section, all UNIV 1301 sections will help students achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Develop and apply elements of leadership through effective individual participation and meaningful team collaboration to empower them to be agents of change.</li>
	<li>Examine the roles and responsibilities crucial for their success in college and beyond.</li>
	<li>Identify, assess, and build on their strengths and experiences to develop academic and transitional strategies necessary for success in their academic, career and life goals.</li>
	<li>Engage in research and critical thinking activities that demonstrate their ability to effectively integrate their learning within, across and beyond academic settings.</li>
	<li>Engage in campus and community activities to increase their sense of academic and social belonging.</li>
</ul>
<p>ESP teaches UNIV 1301 sections designated for first-year students with fewer than 30 semester credit hours and also offers UNIV 1301 sections for transfer students who are in their first or second semester at UTEP and who have earned 30 or more semester credit hours. To learn more visit the ESP website.</p>
<h4>Entering Student Program Learning Communities</h4>
<p>The Entering Student Program also coordinates learning communities for entering students. Learning communities connect students through linked courses. Students enrolled in learning communities attend two or three courses together; for example, a &quot;community&quot; of students might be enrolled together in an English and a history class. Sharing courses in this way increases students' opportunities to make friends, form study groups, work closely with faculty, and connect ideas across courses. Learning community courses are identified in class schedule each Fall Semester.</p>

<p>The Department of Housing and Residence Life is dedicated to creating a living-learning community that is vital to the UTEP college experience.  Students living on campus tend to achieve higher grades, have more leadership opportunities, take advantage of campus programs, and graduate at higher rates than their non-resident counterparts.  Each residential area on campus has dedicated staff available 24 hours a day with direct contact to the UTEP Police Department and Facilities services if an emergency arises. Living on campus allows students to take advantage of everything UTEP and the City of El Paso has to offer.</p>

<p>Housing charges are billed to the student’s Goldmine account before the start of each semester, and may be paid with awarded financial aid packages and University Payment Plans.

<p>All rooms are assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis.  Interested students should submit a housing application and pay the $200 deposit on the Housing and Residence Life website to secure their space on campus.   Housing contracts are available for the academic year while classes are in session, and can be extended through the summer if necessary.  Current rates and apartment floorplans are available on the Housing and Residence Life website.</p>
