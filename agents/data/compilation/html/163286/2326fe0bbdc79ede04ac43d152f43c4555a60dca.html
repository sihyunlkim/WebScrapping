    <p>The University of Maryland, College Park is an academic community. Its fundamental purpose is the pursuit of knowledge. The University functions properly in fulfilling this mission when its community members adhere to clearly established goals and values. Essential to the fundamental purpose of the University is the commitment to the principles of truth and academic honesty.</p><p>Academic Misconduct is a corrosive force in the academic life of a university. It jeopardizes the quality of education and depreciates the genuine achievements of others. It is, without reservation, the responsibility of all members of the campus community to actively deter it. Apathy or acquiescence in the presence of Academic Misconduct is not a neutral act. Histories of institutions demonstrate that indifference will reinforce, perpetuate, and enlarge the scope of such misconduct. Institutional reputations for Academic Misconduct are regrettable aspects of modern education. These reputations become self-fulfilling and grow, unless vigorously challenged by Students, Instructors, and all campus community members.</p><p>The <em>Code of Academic Integrity (Code)</em> is designed to ensure that the principle of academic honesty is upheld.</p>

Instructors are urged to emphasize the importance of academic honesty and of the Honor Pledge as its symbol. Instructors should reference both the Honor Pledge and this <em>Code</em> on syllabi&nbsp;and throughout the course period, including instruction and guidance on avoiding plagiarism through proper citation and links to additional online or web-based materials.<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li>On all work submitted for assessment that is not specifically exempted by the Instructor, Students are encouraged to write and sign the following pledge:<br aria-hidden="true" /><br aria-hidden="true" /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pledge on my honor that I have not given or received any unauthorized assistance on this assessment.</em></li><li>Failure to sign the pledge is not a violation of the <em>Code of Academic Integrity</em>, but neither is it a defense in case of violation of this <em>Code</em>. Signing or non-signing the pledge will not be considered in grading or in the investigation, resolution, or adjudication procedures provided in this <em>Code</em>.</li><li>On examinations, no assistance is permitted unless authorized or expressly allowed by the Instructor.</li><li>On assignments that are not examinations, the Honor Pledge means that the assignment has been done without Academic Misconduct, as defined in this <em>Code</em>.

Student Honor Council members found responsible (or guilty in the case of criminal charges) for any such violation or offense may be disqualified from any further participation in the University Student Judiciary by the Director of Student Conduct. Additional grounds and procedures for removal may also be set forth in the bylaws of the University Student Judiciary.</li></ol></li></ol>

    <p>Students found responsible for Academic Misconduct are subject to Sanctions. The aims of sanctioning are to protect the campus community, deter future offenses, promote individual accountability, and enhance an individual’s ethical development and decision-making. Reasonable efforts are made to educate and support Students in reaching their academic and personal goals while fostering a climate of accountability and responsibility for their actions.</p><p>The sanctioning process for a potential violation of the <em>Code</em> is focused on specific behavior; it is not a judgment of a student’s whole character. To make a judgment of a Student’s overall character is antithetical to the educational goals of the resolution process. Therefore, character witnesses and character statements are not required in the resolution process.</p><p>While all Academic Misconduct matters differ in their severity and complexity, the Office of Student Conduct endeavors to address similar facts and circumstances for Students in the same status, e.g., undergraduate or graduate, consistently. The listed Sanctions are guidelines to inform campus community members of the potential impact of being found responsible for Academic Misconduct. Attempts to commit acts prohibited by this <em>Code</em> may be sanctioned to the same extent as completed violations.</p><p>The expected sanction for undergraduate Students found responsible for violating the <em>Code of Academic Integrity</em> on a Major Graded Assessment as determined by the Instructor is the grade of “XF” in the course.</p><p>The expected Sanction for graduate Students is the permanent grade of “XF” and Expulsion or Suspension.</p><p>A lesser or more severe Sanction, including a different form of grade adjustment, may be recommended or imposed depending on the nature of the alleged Academic Misconduct and consideration of Mitigating or Aggravating Factors as defined in this <em>Code</em>.</p><p>In addition to the Sanctions provided in this <em>Code</em>, a finding of responsibility for Academic Misconduct might affect a Responding Party’s University employment status and assistantship participation. The Responding Party also may be subject to disciplinary actions in accordance with guidelines governing their employment or assistantship. Academic or extracurricular programs may also impose their own penalties for Responding Parties found responsible for Academic Misconduct.</p><p>Possible Sanctions under this <em>Code</em> include the following:</p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-latin;"><li>Grade Adjustments<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li>The grade of “XF” for the course.<ol style="list-style-type:lower-latin;"><li>The grade “XF” is recorded on the Student’s transcript with the notation “failure due to Academic Misconduct.” The grade of “XF” is treated in the same way as an “F” for the purposes of determining grade point average, course repeatability, and academic standing.</li><li>A Student with an “XF” on their transcript may not be permitted to represent the University in any extracurricular activity (for example, intercollegiate athletics, sports clubs, traveling performance groups, competitive events, etc.), or run for or hold office in any Student or University organization that is allowed to use University facilities or receives University funds. The Director of Student Conduct will determine any applicable restrictions on a case-by-case basis.</li><li>The normal duration of the placement of the “XF” is twelve (12) months. If unusual and compelling Mitigating Factors are presented, an abbreviated “XF” for six (6) months may be considered. If serious Aggravating Factors are presented, the “XF” may be designated as a permanent notation on the Student’s transcript for the course or academic exercise in question.</li><li>The “XF” will be paired with an educational Sanction to be completed by the Responding Party before the “XF” is eligible to be removed.</li><li>The grade of "XF" will be replaced with a grade of "F" following the completion of the Sanction duration and the educational Sanction. The "F" grade will remain on as the Student's grade for the course or other academic exercise permanently.</li></ol></li><li>The grade of “F” for the course: A grade of “F” may be imposed for the course or other academic exercise in which Academic Misconduct occurred. The grade of “F” factors into the determination of the Student’s grade point average, eligibility for course repeatability, and academic standing.</li><li>Letter grade reduction for the course: A Student may receive a full letter grade reduction for the course or other academic exercise in which Academic Misconduct occurred. This Sanction is in addition to the Sanction set forth in subparagraph 4 below.</li><li>Zero on the assignment(s): A Student may be given no credit for the assignment(s) in which Academic Misconduct occurred. The Instructor will factor the zero into the Student’s final grade in the course or other academic exercise (before application of the letter grade reduction in subparagraph 3 above, if applicable).</li></ol></li><li>Degree Revocation: rescinding a degree previously awarded by the University. A permanent notation will appear on the Student’s transcript. (Degree Revocation requires administrative review and approval of the Dean of Students.)</li><li>Expulsion: permanent separation of the Student from the University. A permanent notation will appear on the Student’s transcript. In addition, the Director of Student Conduct may also bar the Student from University premises. (Expulsion requires administrative review and approval by the Dean of Students, who may alter, defer, or withhold the Expulsion.)</li><li>Suspension: separation of the Student from the University for a specified period of time. A permanent notation will appear on the Student’s transcript. The Student cannot participate in any University-sponsored activity and may be barred from University premises during the period of Suspension. Suspended time will not count against any time limits required by the Graduate School for completion of a degree. (Suspension requires administrative review and approval by the Dean of Students, who may alter, defer, or withhold the Suspension.)</li><li>Other Sanctions: other Sanctions may be imposed in addition to those specified in this section of the <em>Code</em>. Other Sanctions may include educational or reflective experiences that encourage the Student to prevent repeated acts of Academic Misconduct or help the Student better understand how their Academic Misconduct affects the academic and professional communities of which the Student is a member.</li></ol>

The referral and resolution of reports of Academic Misconduct must be free of conflict of interest or bias and consistent for similar conduct and for all participants alleged to be involved and complicit in the conduct.

It is the responsibility of all persons at an Honor Review to assist in a thorough and honest exposition of all related facts.<br aria-hidden="true" /><br aria-hidden="true" />An Honor Review is a confidential investigation. It requires a deliberative and candid atmosphere, free from distraction. As such, Honor Reviews are not open to the public or others interested in the matter. The Honor Board may conduct its private deliberations at such times and places as it deems appropriate.<br aria-hidden="true" /><br aria-hidden="true" />Honor Reviews are conducted by an Honor Board convened by the Student Honor Council, which is a branch of the University Judiciary.<br aria-hidden="true" /><ol style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li>Right to an Honor Review<ol style="list-style-type:lower-latin;"><li>Responding Parties who face a potential Sanction of the grade of “XF,” Suspension, Expulsion, or Degree Revocation have the right to an Honor Review.</li><li>Responding Parties do not have a right to an Honor Review in&nbsp;matters that do not have the potential to result in a Sanction of the grade of “XF,” Suspension, Expulsion, or Degree Revocation.</li><li>Responding Parties who resolve matters via an Informal Resolution, Disciplinary Conference, or Disciplinary Conference Board waive their right to an Honor Review.</li></ol></li><li>Honor Board Composition<br aria-hidden="true" />Normally, an Honor Board consists of up to six (6) members: three (3) to five (5) voting members and one (1) non-voting Presiding Officer. Honor Boards are selected as follows:<ol style="list-style-type:lower-latin;"><li>Voting Members:<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;"><li>Two (2) to three (3) Student Honor Council members will be selected by the Office of Student Conduct. If the Responding Party is a graduate Student, then at least one (1) member will be a graduate Student.</li><li>One (1) to two (2) faculty or staff members will be selected by the Office of Student Conduct. If the Responding Party is a graduate Student, the Honor Board will include a faculty member who teaches graduate courses.</li></ol></li><li>Presiding Officer:&nbsp;The Presiding Officer may be a University Student, faculty, or staff member and will be selected by the Director of Student Conduct.</li></ol></li><li>Honor Boards may be advised by a University staff member as designated by the Director of Student Conduct. A Board advisor is a non-voting member of the Board and has all the privileges of Board members, including the ability to comment on questions of procedure and on the relevance of evidence, and will otherwise assist in the administration of the Honor Review.</li><li>Procedural Protections for a Responding Party<br aria-hidden="true" />A Responding Party who proceeds with resolving an Academic Misconduct matter in an Honor Review is accorded the following procedural protections:<ol style="list-style-type:lower-latin;"><li>At least five (5) Days advance written notice of the date, time, and location for the Honor Review.<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;"><li>If a Responding Party fails to attend their scheduled Honor Review, a response of not responsible will be considered on behalf of that Responding Party, and the scheduled Honor Review will proceed in their absence.</li></ol></li><li>At least five (5) Days prior to the scheduled Honor Review, written notice of the Formal Charge prepared by the Office of Student Conduct that reasonably advises the Responding Party of the alleged violations and the acts and circumstances that will be considered by the Honor Board to allow the Responding Party to contribute to the Honor Review in a meaningful way.<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;"><li>The Formal Charge may be modified as the discussion in the Honor Review proceeds, as long as the Responding Party is provided notice of the modification and a reasonable opportunity to prepare a response. Recesses or postponements may be granted by the Presiding Officer as needed to allow the Responding Party to review a modified charge and prepare a response.</li></ol></li><li>Reasonable access to the case file prior to and during the Honor Review.</li><li>An opportunity to respond to the evidence against them and to call appropriate witnesses on their behalf.</li><li>The option to be assisted by an Advisor, who may be an attorney retained by the Responding Party, and an Advocate and accompanied by a Support Person.</li></ol></li><li>Honor Review Proceedings<br aria-hidden="true" />An Honor Review is not a criminal or civil legal proceeding. It is not modeled on these adversarial systems, nor does it serve the same functions. It is not a court or tribunal. Rather, it is an academic process unique to the community of scholars that comprise a university. Formal rules of evidence are not applicable to Honor Review proceedings.<ol style="list-style-type:lower-latin;"><li>Notification of Alleged Academic Misconduct<br aria-hidden="true" />The Office of Student Conduct will prepare a Formal Charge of Academic Misconduct and send it to the Responding Party and the Honor Board with appropriate written notice.</li><li>Role and Authority of the Presiding Officer<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;"><li>The Presiding Officer exercises impartial control over the Honor Review to achieve an equitable, orderly, timely, and efficient process.</li><li>The Presiding Officer is authorized to make all decisions and rulings that are necessary and proper to achieve that end, including final decisions related to scheduling and to the inclusion of information in the record.</li><li>&nbsp;The Presiding Officer will admit all evidence, meaning documents, other information and witnesses, into consideration that reasonable persons would accept as relevant, significant, and important to the issues being decided in the&nbsp;matter. Unnecessarily repetitious, irrelevant, or prejudicial evidence may be excluded at the discretion of the Presiding Officer.</li><li>If in the judgment of the Presiding Officer there is reasonable cause to question the impartiality of an Honor Board member, the Presiding Officer will inform the Director of Student Conduct, who will reconstitute the Honor Board.</li><li>The Presiding Officer may direct witnesses to appear upon the motion of any Honor Board member or at the request of the Community Advocate or the Responding Party.</li><li>The Presiding Officer may exclude witnesses from the Honor Review except during the time they are providing information to the Board.</li><li>The Presiding Officer has the discretion to remove any person who disrupts or impedes the investigation, or who fails to adhere to the rulings of the Presiding Officer.</li><li>The Presiding Officer may modify procedural guidelines when necessary.</li></ol></li><li>Honor Review Procedures<br aria-hidden="true" />An Honor Review normally is conducted in the following manner:<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;"><li>Both parties have an opportunity to share any relevant information, analysis, or arguments.</li><li>The Community Advocate will summarize the matter before the Honor Board first, followed by a summary presented by the Responding Party (or their Advocate).</li><li>The Community Advocate will present and question witnesses, and offer documents or other materials relevant to the&nbsp;matter. The Responding Party (or their Advocate) will then present and question witnesses, and offer documents or other materials relevant to the&nbsp;matter. The Community Advocate, the Responding Party (or their Advocate), and all members of the Honor Board may question any witness appearing before the Board.</li><li>The members of the Honor Board may ask the Reporting Party, the Community Advocate, or the Responding Party any relevant questions. The Honor Board members may also request any additional material or the appearance of other witnesses, as appropriate.</li><li>The Community Advocate may make a brief closing statement, followed by a brief closing statement by the Responding Party (or their Advocate).</li></ol></li><li>Honor Board Determinations<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;"><li>The Honor Board will meet privately to consider all the information before them to determine whether the Responding Party is responsible for Academic Misconduct or an attempt thereof.</li><li>Responsible or Not Responsible Determination<ol style="list-style-type:lower-latin;"><li>If a majority of the Honor Board does not find that there is clear and convincing evidence that the Responding Party is responsible for Academic Misconduct or an attempt thereof, the Honor Board will dismiss the charge of Academic Misconduct, and the matter is concluded.</li><li>The Honor Board shall find the Responding Party responsible for Academic Misconduct or an attempt thereof if, by a majority vote of the Honor Board members, it determines that such a conclusion is supported by clear and convincing evidence. In such an event, Sanction recommendations will be collected from both parties.</li></ol></li><li>Sanction Recommendation: If the Honor Board finds the Responding Party is responsible for Academic Misconduct, the Community Advocate and the Responding Party (or their Advocate) may recommend an appropriate Sanction. Pertinent documents or other material may be submitted for the Honor Board’s consideration, including information related to Aggravating and Mitigating Factors. The Honor Board will then meet privately to develop a recommendation regarding the Sanction by a majority vote.</li><li>Board Outcome Notification: The Presiding Officer will provide the Office of Student Conduct with a written report of the Honor Board’s responsibility determination and Sanction recommendation, if appropriate, including stating the Aggravating Factors and Mitigating Factors that were considered.</li></ol></li><li>Final Sanction Notification<br aria-hidden="true" />Based on the Honor Board determining the Responding Party is responsible for Academic Misconduct or an attempt thereof and consideration of the Honor Board’s Sanction recommendation, the Director of Student Conduct will impose an appropriate Sanction.<br aria-hidden="true" /><br aria-hidden="true" />The Office of Student Conduct will notify the Responding Party of the imposed Sanction.</li><li>Appeal<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;"><li>A Responding Party who is found responsible may appeal the responsibility determination and imposed Sanction as provided in the Appeals section of this <em>Code</em>.</li><li>The Reporting Party and the Instructor cannot appeal a final determination.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol>

    <p>Appeals are not intended to allow for a second review of the facts of the&nbsp;matter and determination of whether the Responding Party is responsible for Academic Misconduct.

Office of Student Conduct The Office of Student Conduct (OSC) and its Director are charged with the administration of the Code of Academic Integrity and its processes. The responsibilities of the OSC include: Providing official and final interpretation of the Code ; Accepting reports of alleged Academic Misconduct; Determining the appropriate alleged violation(s) to be filed in accordance with this Code ; Administering the process and procedures for investigating and resolving alleged Code violations; Supervising, training, and advising all conduct boards; and Maintaining all Student disciplinary records in accordance with this Policy. Referral to Another University Process In cases where an allegation of Academic Misconduct could also be a violation of Policy III-1.10(A) University of Maryland Policy and Procedures Concerning Scholarly Misconduct (the “Scholarly Misconduct Policy”), the Director of Student Conduct and the University’s Research Integrity Officer (RIO) will determine whether this Code or the Scholarly Misconduct Policy will apply. When a scholarly misconduct process results in a finding of responsibility for a current or former Student, the RIO may refer the matter to the Office of Student Conduct for review under this Code , including for application of a Sanction if the Student was found responsible under the scholarly misconduct process. Responding Parties found responsible for Academic Misconduct may also be subject to a program review for continued participation in their academic and University sponsored scholarship programs, in addition to any Sanctions imposed under the Code. “Formal Charge” is a written notice of the alleged violations of Academic Misconduct that will be considered during an Honor Review by an Honor Board. Student Honor Council members found responsible (or guilty in the case of criminal charges) for any such violation or offense may be disqualified from any further participation in the University Student Judiciary by the Director of Student Conduct. While all Academic Misconduct matters differ in their severity and complexity, the Office of Student Conduct endeavors to address similar facts and circumstances for Students in the same status, e.g., undergraduate or graduate, consistently. Prompt reporting to an Instructor or the Office of Student Conduct enhances the University’s ability to respond and address matters related to Academic Misconduct and to provide proper guidance and resolution to Students. Self-Referral Students who commit acts of Academic Misconduct may demonstrate their renewed commitment to academic integrity by reporting themselves in writing to the Office of Student Conduct. Students who elect to self-refer for Academic Misconduct are encouraged to utilize the Office of Student Conduct electronic referral form found here online to detail the incident. Recommendation If an investigation by the Director of Student Conduct reveals that no member of the University had a suspicion of a self-referring Student’s act of Academic Misconduct and the Self-Referral is accepted, the Student will not be charged with Academic Misconduct or have a disciplinary record for the reported incident. In addition, at the discretion of the Instructor, the Student may have the grade for the work that resulted from the Academic Misconduct reduced to a zero, by one letter grade, or to an “F.” If the Director of Student Conduct determines that Academic Misconduct was suspected at the time of the Student’s Self-Referral and admission, the matter will be resolved in accordance with the Resolution Procedures specified in this Code for resolving Academic Misconduct allegations.
