    <p>Due to the large number of student organizations at UMCP, it is necessary to establish a process to identify those student groups which will receive University support, and thereby establish a basis of a relationship between the University and the organization. The UMCP Office of Campus Activities was created to support the development of individual students by promoting involvement opportunities; assisting students in making choices about co-curricular activities; facilitating the integration of those experiences into their self concept and total development; and recognizing outstanding achievement in those endeavors. One of the primary functions of the office is to provide assistance to student organizations.</p><p>The Office of Campus Activities has developed a registration process for student organizations. This process serves many purposes. First, it offers structure by providing parameters in which organizations can function. Secondly, it establishes a communication pattern between organizations and the Office of Campus Activities to provide support and stability for activities. Finally, it clearly defines consequences for groups which choose not to exist in accordance with these guidelines.</p><p>Following are the registration procedures and guidelines for UMCP students.</p>

Student Organization Definition A student organization is defined as any registered group/organization at UMCP which is directed and controlled by students of the University of Maryland whose programs and activities affect the educational process, promote cultural understanding and student welfare, and/or contribute to the overall community within the University of Maryland College Park. Registration shall be defined as the process whereby a student organization acquires eligibility to receive University support as described in Section III.D. The relationship between the University and registered student organizations generates neither a contractual- relationship between the University and the organization, nor a property right or expectancy in the organization of any sort. Probationary: Probationary status is placed by the Office of Campus Activities upon a student organization which has been registered and involved in judicial violations and/or violation of University policies, procedures and guidelines. Registration Process The officer(s) must meet with the Office of Campus Activities to determine the appropriate type of registration. Continuing and Temporary Registration Process Registration for Continuing and Temporary Registration Status will require one of the following two processes: Renewal Registration: If the Office of Campus Activities has a current file on an organization, the organization must renew its registration one month after the organization's officer elections occur, or a change is made in the organization's constitution, address or stated purpose.
