            PRIMARY PRINCIPLES: FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY

    <p>Freedom of expression and an open environment to pursue scholarly inquiry and for sharing of information are encouraged, supported, and protected at the University of Maryland. These values lie at the core of our academic community. Censorship is not compatible with the tradition and goals of the University. While some computing resources are dedicated to specific research, teaching, or administrative tasks that would limit their use, freedom of expression must, in general, be protected. The University does not limit access to information because of its content when it meets the standard of legality. The University's policy of freedom of expression applies to computing resources. Concomitant with free expression are personal obligations of each member of our community to use computing resources responsibly, ethically, and in a manner which accords both with the law and the rights of others. The University depends first upon a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation to create and maintain an open community of responsible users.</p>

These resources are extended for the sole use of University faculty, staff, students, and all other authorized guests to accomplish tasks related to the status of that individual at the University, and consistent with the University’s mission.</p><p>Those using University IT resources, whether at the University or elsewhere, are responsible for complying with security standards set forth by the Vice President and Chief Information Officer (VP/CIO), safeguarding identification codes and passwords, and for using them solely for their intended purposes. Individuals are solely responsible for their personal use of IT resources and are prohibited from representing or implying that statements related to such use constitute the views or policies of the University.&nbsp;</p><p>The maintenance, operation, and security of IT resources require responsible University personnel to monitor and access systems and networks. To the extent possible in the electronic environment and in a public setting, a user’s privacy will be preserved.
