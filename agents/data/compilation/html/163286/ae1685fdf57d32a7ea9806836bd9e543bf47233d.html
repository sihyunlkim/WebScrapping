Necessity for Written Request All requests for inspection of public records shall be in writing, via surface mail or email unless the custodian of the record being requested specifically waives the requirement. Filing the Request A written request for inspection of a public record shall be sent by surface mail or email and addressed to the custodian having physical custody and control of the record. Response to a Request Upon receipt of a request to inspect or copy public records, the custodian shall make a search for potentially responsive public records, and grant or deny the request promptly within a reasonable period, not to exceed 30 daysV If a requested public record is not in the custody and control of the person to whom the written application is made, that person shall notify the applicant of that fact within 10 working days of receipt of the request, and provide the name of the custodian and the location or possible location of the record, if known. In the event a request to inspect or copy a public record is denied, within 10 working days of the denial the custodian shall provide the applicant with a written statement that includes the following: the reasons for the denial; the legal authority for the denial; and notification of the right to seek judicial review in accordance with §10- 623 of the Act. Unless prohibited by law, the custodian may, in his or her discretion, notify any person in interest that a request for inspection of a public record has been made. Guidelines for Determining Access Denial of Access The custodian shall deny access to the following records as required by §10-615 through §10-617 of the Act: letters of reference for employees and students; library circulation records; library, archival, or museum material given by a donor who limits disclosure as a condition of the gift; sociological information if the custodian has adopted rules or regulations defining the term; confidential commercial, financial, geological or geophysical information or trade secret provided by or obtained from another; public employees' home addresses or telephone numbers, unless permission is given or inspection is deemed necessary to protect the public interest; information about the security of an information system; student educational records; NOTE: Disclosure is restricted by the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act; the UNIVERSITY POLICY ON CONFIDENTIALITY AND DISCLOSURE OF STUDENT RECORDS should be consulted. Permissible Denials Unless otherwise provided by law, a custodian may deny inspection of part of the following public records if it is believed that inspection would be contrary to the public interest: inter-agency and intra-agency documents that would not be available by law to a private party in litigation; examinations including test questions, scoring keys; NOTE: A person in interest may inspect an examination after it has been given and graded, but may not copy the document. The custodian may not charge for the first two hours needed to search for a public record and prepare it for inspection or copying, provided, however, that in accounting for this time, serial requests from the same applicant for the same or related records shall be considered as one request. If a copy of a record cannot be made using a University photocopy machine, the custodian shall make arrangements for reproduction to occur outside the institution, provided, however, at no time shall custody of the records be given to an applicant for this purpose.","headline":"University of Maryland, College Park Guidelines and Procedures Governing the Inspection of Public Records","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://umd-policies.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/images/informal-seal-social-card.png?w=1200&h=630&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1637273922&s=5218b465528a21513dafb8144841e3c6"},"inLanguage":"en-us","mainEntityOfPage":"https://policies.umd.edu/general-administration/university-of-maryland-college-park-guidelines-and-procedures-governing-the-inspection-of-public-records","name":"University of Maryland, College Park Guidelines and Procedures Governing the Inspection of Public Records","publisher":{"@id":"https://umd.edu#creator"},"url":"https://policies.umd.edu/general-administration/university-of-maryland-college-park-guidelines-and-procedures-governing-the-inspection-of-public-records"},{"@id":"https://umd.edu#identity","@type":"CollegeOrUniversity","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressCountry":"US","addressLocality":"College Park","addressRegion":"MD","postalCode":"20742","streetAddress":"1101 Main Administration Building"},"alternateName":"UMD","description":"The Flagship Institution of the University System of Maryland","email":"president@umd.edu","geo":{"@type":"GeoCoordinates","latitude":"38.9859963","longitude":"-76.9420532"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","height":"600","url":"https://policies.umd.edu/images/informal-seal-social-card.png","width":"1200"},"logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","height":"60","url":"https://umd-policies.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/images/informal-seal-social-card.png?w=600&h=60&q=82&fm=png&fit=clip&dm=1637273922&s=406e9edd134a9d2083ee1a4109629f49","width":"120"},"name":"The University of Maryland","sameAs":["https://twitter.com/UofMaryland","https://www.facebook.com/UnivofMaryland","https://www.youtube.com/user/UMD2101","https://www.instagram.com/univofmaryland/"],"telephone":"301-405-5803","url":"https://umd.edu"},{"@id":"https://umd.edu#creator","@type":"CollegeOrUniversity","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressCountry":"US","addressLocality":"College Park","addressRegion":"College Park","postalCode":"20740","streetAddress":"1101 Main Administration Building"},"alternateName":"UMD","description":"The Flagship Institution of the University System of Maryland","email":"president@umd.edu","geo":{"@type":"GeoCoordinates","latitude":"38.9859963","longitude":"-76.9420532"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","height":"600","url":"https://policies.umd.edu/images/informal-seal-social-card.png","width":"1200"},"logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","height":"60","url":"https://umd-policies.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/images/informal-seal-social-card.png?w=600&h=60&q=82&fm=png&fit=clip&dm=1637273922&s=406e9edd134a9d2083ee1a4109629f49","width":"120"},"name":"The University of Maryland","telephone":"301-405-5803","url":"https://umd.edu"},{"@type":"BreadcrumbList","description":"Breadcrumbs list","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","item":"https://policies.umd.edu/","name":"Home","position":1},{"@type":"ListItem","item":"https://policies.umd.edu/general-administration","name":"General Administration","position":2},{"@type":"ListItem","item":"https://policies.umd.edu/general-administration/university-of-maryland-college-park-guidelines-and-procedures-governing-the-inspection-of-public-records","name":"University of Maryland, College Park Guidelines and Procedures Governing the Inspection of Public Records","position":3}],"name":"Breadcrumbs"}]}</script><script src="/index.js?v=1745252936"></script></body>
