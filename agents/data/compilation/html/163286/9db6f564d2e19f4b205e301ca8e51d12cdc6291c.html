    <p>It is essential that student-athletes know the NCAA rules related to professional sports. An infraction of the rules concerning agents could have severe negative consequences for the University and the student-athlete. NCAA rules pertaining to sport agents and professional sports counseling panels:</p><ol><li>FORBID an athlete to agree, either orally or in writing, to be represented by an agent or organization in the marketing of his or her athletic ability or reputation until after the completion of the last intercollegiate contest, including post-season games. This NCAA prohibition includes an agreement that is not effective until after the last game.</li><li>FORBID an athlete or his or her representative to enter into a playing contract either orally or in writing, regardless of the legal enforceability of that agreement, in that sport in which the athlete intends to compete intercollegiately.</li><li>FORBID an athlete or his or her representative to accept remuneration for or permit the use of his or her name or picture to advertise, recommend, promote or endorse the sale or use of a commercial or service of any kind.</li><li>FORBID an athlete to ask to be placed on a professional league's draft list, whether or not the athlete withdraws his or her name before the draft, whether or not the athlete is actually drafted, and whether or not the athlete signs a professional contract.</li><li>FORBID an athlete to accept expenses or gifts of any kind (including meals and transportation) from an agent (or anyone else) who wishes to provide services to the student-athlete. Such payment is not allowed because it would be compensation based on athletic skills and a preferential benefit not available to other students.</li><li>FORBID an athlete to receive preferential benefits or treatments (for example, loans with deferred pay-back basis) because of the athlete's reputation, skill, or potential as a professional athlete.</li><li>FORBID an athlete to retain professional services for personal reasons at less than the normal charge from a representative of his school's athletic interest.</li></ol><p>Neither Maryland law nor the NCAA rules prohibit a student- athlete from contacting an agent for informational purposes. However, since all agents must be licensed by the State, the Athletic Department believes that it is in the student- athlete's best interests for him/her to confer with the Associate Athletic Director for Compliance about the license status of a prospective agent or other third party. Moreover, agents or other third parties may not contact student-athletes without first having received permission to do so from the Associate Athletic Director for Compliance.</p><p>If a student-athlete does not inform the Associate Athletic Director for Compliance that he/she has been contacted in person or by phone by an agent or other third party without Athletic Department permission for such contact, the student will receive a written warning that a second contact may result in possible sanctions. A second violation will be grounds for sanction to be determined by the Director of Athletics. The sanction may include denial of future eligibility for competition at the University of Maryland.</p><p>A student-athlete who signs a contract to be represented by an agent in the marketing of the individual's athletic ability is no longer eligible to compete in intercollegiate athletics in that sport. The Associate Athletic Director for Compliance shall immediately declare the student-athlete ineligible for further competition and fully disclose the infraction to appropriate authorities.</p>

    <p>Violations of University policy regarding academics, residence life and general conduct are handled in the same manner as for the general student body.

Reports are then filed with the Atlantic Coast Conference and the NCAA offices according to established reporting procedures.</p><p>If a student-athlete is found to be in violation of University, ACC or NCAA policy, the penalty imposed depends upon the severity of the offense and may include the following:</p><ul><li>probation;</li><li>dismissal from the squad;</li><li>cancellation or gradation of the grant-in-aid; and/or</li><li>dismissal from the University.</li></ul>
