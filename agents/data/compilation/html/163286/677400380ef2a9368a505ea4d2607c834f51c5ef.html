The University of Maryland is therefore committed to having a campus that is free of the illegal or abusive use of drugs and alcohol. In keeping with this commitment, it is the policy of the University that the illegal or abusive use of drugs or alcohol is prohibited on University property or as part of University activities.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to inform all students of their responsibilities and the possible penalties for violations of this policy, the following rules, standards of conduct, and sanctions are set forth.</p>
