<H2>Use at Your Own Risk</H2>

<P>As you know, many AI tools are available freely online.  We discourage you from using random tools
as a learning aid, as such tools routinely fabricate information as part of their answers and 
generally provide no insight as to their own accuracy.  Indeed, they are constructed without even
the capacity to know the extent of their "knowledge" or lack thereof.</P>

<P>That said, we know that many of you enjoy playing with these tools and may try to find information through them,
especially since many search engines now integrate them (sometimes with no other option).</P>

<P>If you choose to use any tool other than course materials (textbook, slides) and staff (professor, TA), 
you assume all risk in doing so.  If you are provided with incorrect information that subsequently use in
an assignment or exam (or a job!), you will not be given any credit for having made such a mistake.  Please do
not ask.<P>

<P>Furthermore, if a tool ingests code or answers written by another person and subsequently provides you with that
material, leading us to detect plagiarism in your assignment or exam answers, <B>you will be held fully responsible for
an academic integrity violation.</B></P>

<H2>Do Not Use for Quizzes or Exams</H2>

<P>Any material not explicitly allowed for use during a quiz or exam is forbidden, including any sort of AI tool.
Although in many cases we may not be able to detect such use, please be aware that if we do detect use, we will
be forced to charge you with an academic integrity violation (and to follow the class policy in penalizing you).</P>

<H2>Class-Related Chatbot</H2>

<P>The CAII team at NCSA has been developing a ChatBot for the course based on ChatGPT-4 and extended with the course
materials.  As mentioned above, <B>THIS CHATBOT IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE COURSE STAFF</B>.  On the positive side, answers
from this ChatBot do typically include references to course material, so if you follow the links and find answers in the original material rather than relying solely on the summary produced by the ChatBot, you should be ok.</P>

<P>You can find the ChatBot here: <A HREF="https://www.uiuc.chat/ECE408SP24/chat">https://www.uiuc.chat/ECE408SP24/chat</A></P>
