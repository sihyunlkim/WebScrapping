To help faculty integrate artificial intelligence in higher education courses, the AI Institute developed the <a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67ad686b0a3e3ff8db279ca9/67b4ad05438165122a358113_AI%20Learning%20Framework%20with%20logo%20v2.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>AI Learning Framework</strong></a>, a structured approach to help instructors assess how effectively AI is being used. This framework not only guides instructors but also ensures that students are prepared for an AI-driven future.</p><p>The AI Learning Framework consists of five levels, ranging from no AI integration to fully AI-transformed learning experiences:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Level 0: No Integration of AI</strong> –Courses at this level do not incorporate AI in any capacity, either in content or assignments.</li><li><strong>Level 1: Basic Integration</strong> –Faculty introduce AI concepts through lectures and discussions but without hands-on application.</li><li><strong>Level 2: Extensive Integration</strong> –AI tools become part of assignments, projects, and discussions, fostering hands-on learning.</li><li><strong>Level 3: AI-Enabled Personalized Learning</strong> –AI is used to tailor content and assessments to individual students, enhancing engagement.</li><li><strong>Level 4: AI-Transformed Learning</strong> –AI deeply personalizes education, reshaping both course content and the learning experience.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h2><strong>AI in action</strong></h2><p>Chair &amp; Katz Endowed Professor of Management Ivan Guardiola and Associate Professor of Marketing &amp; Katz Endowed Professor Tom Miaskiewicz have embraced AI in their teaching, experimenting with new ways to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes.</p><p>Miaskiewicz has leveraged AI to create personalized learning experiences for his students. He has integrated AI assistants into his courses for students to interact with, and that adapt to students’ needs and tailor learning experiences around specific assignments and class concepts. </p><p>“While the core learning objectives of individual classes remain unchanged, this approach significantly alters my role as an educator and the broader goals I aim to achieve as a faculty member. For example, foundational content is now delivered in a personalized manner through AI, allowing me to focus on facilitating active learning and fostering a deeper understanding of the material,” he explains.</p><p>One student noted how AI was able to meet their needs, &quot;I enjoy using AI to help me guide through assignments and writing assignment. There are so many questions that I can ask, and can be answered right away, instead of having to wait for the professor to respond.&quot;</p><p>Guardiola took a similar approach, creating &quot;The Virtual Dr. G,&quot; a customized AI persona that provides students with personalized guidance. By feeding AI his course materials, past exams, academic and nonacademic writing, and even his sense of humor, he has created an interactive tool that helps students engage with course content in a dynamic way. </p><p>&quot;The student asks it questions, and I provide example prompts students can use to access the information in an effective way,&quot; he said.</p><p>After experiencing using the custom AI assistants in their courses, one student saw how it improved their learning. &quot;I have never worked with AI in my courses in this way and it has taught me how to better teach myself and study,&quot; they said.</p><p>Guardiola further encourages students to personalize the responses they’ll receive from the AIs used in his courses. “Students feed the GPT their personal learning style information so that the GPT takes into account their preferences (perceived preferences) and interests when generating examples. This has been well received by students,” he explained.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Building AI fluency: supporting faculty and students</strong></h2><p>To help faculty navigate AI integration, the AI Institute at FLC has established initiatives like the <a href="/archive/programs-at-the-ai-institute" target="_blank"><strong>Elevate AI Incubator program</strong></a>, which provides professional development, AI platform subscriptions, and financial support. Additionally, workshops through the Center for Teaching and Learning offer hands-on experiences for faculty to experiment with AI tools and strategies. </p><p>Miaskiewicz emphasizes the importance of one-on-one support, stating that faculty moving beyond basic AI integration benefit from more individualized guidance. This level of support ensures that instructors feel confident in using AI to enhance—not replace—traditional teaching methods.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Challenges of implementing AI in college courses</strong></h2><p>While AI offers immense potential, challenges remain. One hurdle to successful AI implementation that Miaskiewicz sees is the cost. </p><p>“My biggest challenge has been the costs associated with paid versions of LLMs like ChatGPT. While I’ve had my students use the free tier, they often encounter usage limits that hinder their ability to complete their work as quickly as they would like,” he said.</p><p>Guardiola warns against students relying too much on AI for easy answers rather than using it as a tool for deeper learning. Some students, he said, “seek the path of least resistance, and AI tools provide that path in many ways, but they are losing out on the betterment of themselves by doing so.”</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Preparing Students for an AI-Powered Future</strong></h2><p>At its core, the AI Learning Framework is about preparing students for a world where AI is an essential tool. Guardiola underscores that AI literacy is becoming a necessity in every field, and students must learn to understand and engage with AI rather than fear it. His message to students, “You sit at the precipice of something transformative—embrace AI and learn how to wield it for the betterment of all.” </p><p>Through this framework, FLC faculty are thoughtfully incorporating AI in ways that enhance student learning, encourage critical thinking, and prepare graduates for an evolving job market.</p><p>‍</p></div></div><section></section><div class="w-layout-blockcontainer w-container"><h1 class="heading-13">Recent Articles</h1></div><div class="w-dyn-list"><div role="list" class="w-dyn-items w-row"><div role="listitem" class="recent-article-item on-blog w-dyn-item w-col w-col-4"><a href="/post/four-corners-ai-conference-highlights-ethical-rural-focused-innovation" class="blog-card w-inline-block"><div class="blog-image-wrap"><img alt="" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67ad686b0a3e3ff8db279d0e/695e9f639533e50a310813a8_Small%204CornersAiConference_FLC_RNOTT-042.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 96vw, (max-width: 767px) 97vw, (max-width: 991px) 31vw, 33vw" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67ad686b0a3e3ff8db279d0e/695e9f639533e50a310813a8_Small%204CornersAiConference_FLC_RNOTT-042-p-500.jpg 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67ad686b0a3e3ff8db279d0e/695e9f639533e50a310813a8_Small%204CornersAiConference_FLC_RNOTT-042-p-800.jpg 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67ad686b0a3e3ff8db279d0e/695e9f639533e50a310813a8_Small%204CornersAiConference_FLC_RNOTT-042-p-1080.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67ad686b0a3e3ff8db279d0e/695e9f639533e50a310813a8_Small%204CornersAiConference_FLC_RNOTT-042-p-1600.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67ad686b0a3e3ff8db279d0e/695e9f639533e50a310813a8_Small%204CornersAiConference_FLC_RNOTT-042-p-2000.jpg 2000w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67ad686b0a3e3ff8db279d0e/695e9f639533e50a310813a8_Small%204CornersAiConference_FLC_RNOTT-042-p-2600.jpg 2600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67ad686b0a3e3ff8db279d0e/695e9f639533e50a310813a8_Small%204CornersAiConference_FLC_RNOTT-042.jpg 3000w" class="blog-image"/><div style="background-color:#96d6f6" class="category"><div>Institute News</div></div></div><div class="blog-content"><div class="detail-text">December 29, 2025</div><h2 class="heading-29">Four Corners AI Conference highlights ethical, rural-focused innovation </h2></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="recent-article-item on-blog w-dyn-item w-col w-col-4"><a href="/post/saso-pilots-ai-to-sharpen-training-and-prevention-education" class="blog-card w-inline-block"><div class="blog-image-wrap"><img alt="SASO staff and volunteers stand in a row" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67ad686b0a3e3ff8db279d0e/6925b6dc725b3cfb209f4034_image004.png" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 96vw, (max-width: 767px) 97vw, (max-width: 991px) 31vw, 33vw" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67ad686b0a3e3ff8db279d0e/6925b6dc725b3cfb209f4034_image004-p-500.png 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67ad686b0a3e3ff8db279d0e/6925b6dc725b3cfb209f4034_image004-p-800.png 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67ad686b0a3e3ff8db279d0e/6925b6dc725b3cfb209f4034_image004.png 1047w" class="blog-image"/><div style="background-color:#133149" class="category"><div>Elevate AI</div></div></div><div class="blog-content"><div class="detail-text">November 25, 2025</div><h2 class="heading-29">SASO pilots AI to sharpen training and prevention education </h2></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="recent-article-item on-blog w-dyn-item w-col w-col-4"><a href="/post/what-questions-do-you-want-ai-to-answer-here-at-home" class="blog-card w-inline-block"><div class="blog-image-wrap"><img alt="&quot;
