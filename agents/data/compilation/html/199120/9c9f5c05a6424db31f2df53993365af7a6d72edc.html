<h2>Title</h2>

<p>The Student Code of Conduct of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</p>

<h2>I. Introduction</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (&quot;University&quot;) is committed to fostering a community where intellectual honesty and personal integrity are highly valued; individuals are trusted, respected, and fairly treated; and there is consistent accountability for conduct that affects the safety and welfare of the University and its members. The activities of students, inside and outside the classroom, impact the educational process and learning environment. Academic as well as non-academic conduct are, therefore, areas of appropriate concern and regulation by the University. This Student Code of Conduct (&quot;Code&quot; or &quot;Code of Conduct&quot;) embraces the ideals of academic honesty, personal integrity, and responsible citizenship that are essential to the University community.</p>

<h3>Disciplinary Authority</h3>

<p>The Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina delegates full authority for the regulation of student conduct and discipline to the Chancellor of the University.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The Chancellor may further delegate this authority to University administrators or other officials. The Code of Conduct and accompanying&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=152518">Student Conduct Procedures</a>&nbsp;(&quot;Procedures&quot;) are adopted pursuant to this authority. Responsibility for the implementation of these policies is delegated through the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs to the Office of Student Conduct (&quot;Student Conduct&quot;).</p>

<h3>Scope and Jurisdiction</h3>

<p>The Code of Conduct establishes the standards and regulations for academic and non-academic conduct by Students and Student Organizations. These terms may be used interchangeably so that Student or Student Organization may also be understood to refer to the other unless an express exception is made. All Students and representatives of Student Organizations are responsible for knowing and complying with this Code.</p>

<p>The Code of Conduct applies to the behavior of Students from when they apply to the University until the awarding of a degree or other termination of enrollment. The University retains jurisdiction over Students who take a leave of absence, withdraw, or have graduated for any violation of the Code that occurred prior to the leave, withdrawal, or graduation. A Student&#39;s application for admission and enrollment in the University presupposes a commitment to the principles set forth in the Code. It further represents a Student&#39;s consent to be bound by the terms of the Code throughout their enrollment, including the period between academic terms.</p>

<p>All conduct by Students or Student Organizations on University Premises or the property of groups recognized or affiliated with the University in violation of this Code of Conduct may be the basis for disciplinary action. The University may consider off-campus behavior when that behavior is detrimental to University interests, the University&#39;s educational mission, and/or members of the University community. Determinations of whether University interests are implicated by off-campus conduct and should result in disciplinary action are reserved to the discretion of Student Conduct.</p>

<h2>II. Policy Statement</h2>

<p>All Students are responsible for conducting themselves in a way that respects the rights, dignity, worth, and freedom of each community member. Violations of University policies or federal, state, or local law may result in a violation of this Code of Conduct.</p>

<p>Lack of knowledge or unfamiliarity with University policy or intoxication or impairment from alcohol, drugs, or other substances are not excuses or defenses to a violation of this Code. Unless specifically noted in the policy definition, intent is not a required element of a charge of misconduct under the Code.</p>

<h3>A. General Expectations and Responsibilities</h3>

<p>To foster a community where academic honesty and personal integrity are highly valued, Students are expected to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Treat all members of the University community with respect and fairness;</li>
	<li>Conduct themselves in a manner that promotes the safety and well-being of the entire University community;</li>
	<li>Consult with faculty and other resources to clarify academic requirements, to learn the techniques of proper attribution of sources, and to identify allowable materials to be used for any academic work;</li>
	<li>Sign a pledge on all academic work certifying that no unauthorized assistance has been given or received in the completion of the work;</li>
	<li>Comply with faculty instructions designed to reduce the possibility of academic misconduct, such as removing unauthorized materials and protecting one&#39;s own work from unauthorized use by others; and</li>
	<li>Report any instance in which reasonable grounds exist to believe that a Student has violated this Code of Conduct.</li>
</ol>

<p>In furtherance of these expectations, it is the responsibility of every Student and Student Organization to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Know and comply with the Code of Conduct;</li>
	<li>Conduct all academic work within the letter and spirit of the Code of Conduct; and</li>
	<li>Refrain from conduct that unreasonably disrupts any normal function of the University or its personnel or jeopardizes the safety and welfare of members of the University community.</li>
</ol>

<p>The prohibited behavior set out in Sections II.B. and II.C. of this Code of Conduct, not these general expectations and responsibilities, will be the basis for determining chargeable offenses under this Code.</p>

<h3>D. Group Offenses</h3>

<p>Student Organizations are subject to the same standards as individual members of the University community. Any offense within section II of this Code committed by a Student Organization shall be the basis for disciplinary action as a group offense. Disciplinary action against a Student Organization may be pursued in addition to or in lieu of disciplinary action against individual members of the Student Organization.</p>

<h3>E. Free Expression and Disciplinary Action</h3>

<p>The University embraces and strives to uphold the freedoms of expression and speech guaranteed by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the North Carolina Constitution. The University has the right, under appropriate circumstances, to regulate the time, place, and manner of exercising these and other constitutionally protected rights. These restrictions will be viewpoint- and content-neutral.</p>

<p>The Code of Conduct does not restrict the ability of Students or Student Organizations to exercise their rights to free expression or regulate the lawful content of that expression. Any disciplinary action pursuant to this Code shall be based on an allegation of specific prohibited or unlawful conduct without regard to any viewpoint associated with the conduct.</p>

<h3>F. Relationship to Other Campus Policies</h3>

<p>The Student Conduct Procedures establish the process for disciplinary action for prohibited behavior covered by the Code of Conduct, the Alcohol Policy, and other conduct-related University policies. Neither the Code nor the Disciplinary Procedures preclude other disciplinary or administrative action as may be assigned to particular University administrative units (including, but not limited to, Carolina Housing, and the University Compliance Office, UNC&nbsp;Research, and Transportation and Parking) through their respective policies.</p>

<p>Before initiating or completing disciplinary action, the University may separately impose interim measures as necessary to address emergency situations involving potential danger to the University community or other extraordinary circumstances as set forth in appropriate University policies.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Where conduct prohibited by this Code involves a Student acting in the capacity of University instructor or employee, such conduct may be addressed under applicable employment policies in addition to or in lieu of action under this Code as determined by appropriate University officials in their sole discretion.</p>

<h3>G. Violations of Law and Disciplinary Action</h3>

<p>The University has a special interest in assuring that students refrain from academic and non-academic misconduct, respect the safety and welfare of members of the University community, and protect its institutional integrity and resources. The standards for student conduct set forth in this Code are adopted in furtherance of this interest and serve to supplement, rather than substitute for, the enforcement of the civil and criminal law applicable at large. Therefore, it is not double jeopardy for the University to sanction conduct that is also sanctioned under local, state, or federal law.</p>

<p>In instances where action is either pending or completed against a Student in a state or federal court and when the University&#39;s interests are affected, Student Conduct shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether campus disciplinary action should be taken independently of the criminal justice system. The University may proceed under this Code and accompanying Procedures prior to, during, or after any criminal arrest or prosecution. The outcome in a civil or criminal court (e.g., dismissal, deferred prosecution, plea bargain, acquittal, finding of liability, or conviction) will not be binding on the student disciplinary process but may be evidence considered during the student disciplinary process.</p>

<p>Alleged violations of law or policy by Students of Student Organizations on other campuses, including constituent institutions of The University of North Carolina may be referred for action under this Code, including, but not limited to, arrests or citations for misconduct, disruption, trespass, or other conduct creating a public safety threat.</p>

<h3>H. Responsibility for Implementation and Enforcement</h3>

<p>Student Conduct shall be responsible for the implementation and enforcement of this Code, assisted by Students, staff, and faculty as set forth in the Procedures. Any member of the University community or the public may report alleged violations of this Code to&nbsp;<a href="https://studentconduct.unc.edu/report-incident/">Student Conduct</a>. To secure the due process rights guaranteed to all Students, members of the University community are expected to report alleged misconduct under this Code to Student Conduct rather than taking unilateral punitive action.</p>

<h3>I. Policy Interpretation, Review, and Amendment</h3>

<p>The Code of Conduct and Student Conduct Procedures are established to provide notice to Students and Student Organizations of expectations, prohibited behaviors, and the processes by which alleged violations will be determined. The Code and Procedures should be read broadly with terms given their plain meaning, except where a term has been expressly defined. Any question or dispute regarding the interpretation or application of the Code and Procedures will be referred to the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs or their designee for final determination. In the event of any conflict between the Code of Conduct or the Student Conduct Procedures and any state or federal law, the legal authority will be controlling, and any applicable legal requirement will be deemed in effect.</p>

<p>The Code and Procedures shall be reviewed regularly and at least every three years by Student Conduct in consultation with other campus units as appropriate. The Code and Procedures may be amended or changed with the approval of the Chancellor at any time. Changes will be communicated to members of the University community through various publications. The most current version of the Code and Procedures can be accessed at the University&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="https://studentconduct.unc.edu/">Student Conduct website</a>.</p>

<p>In consultation with the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Chair of the Faculty, and presidents of the undergraduate and graduate/professional student governments, the Director of Student Conduct shall convene a Student Discipline Advisory Committee comprised of no more than twelve (12) Students, staff, and faculty. The Student Discipline Advisory Committee will meet regularly to advise Student Conduct and Student Affairs regarding matters of student discipline, develop campus education and outreach initiatives, and make recommendations for amendments to this Code of Conduct and the Student Conduct Procedures.</p>
