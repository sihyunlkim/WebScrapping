<h2><a id="calendar-credit-system-and-final-examinations" name="calendar-credit-system-and-final-examinations"></a>Calendar, Credit System and Final Examinations</h2>

<p>The University operates on a semester calendar and uses the semester hour credit system. There are three semesters per twelve-month period: Fall Semester, Spring Semester, and Summer Semester. Each semester consists of fourteen weeks of classes with final examinations occurring during the two or three final examination days. Within each semester, there are two subterms listed on the Academic Calendar at <a href="https://harrisburgu.edu/academic-calendar" target="_blank">https://harrisburgu.edu/academic-calendar</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="credit-hour-policy-program-instructional-equivalencies" name="credit-hour-policy-program-instructional-equivalencies"></a>Credit Hour Policy Program Instructional Equivalencies</h2>

<p>A wide variety of course delivery is utilized. &#8220;Learning hours&#8221; are assigned to each course. Each&#160;&#8220;learning hour&#8221; represents one hour per week of student engagement, including both instructional&#160;and outside of class activities.&#160;The University reserves the right to change the delivery method of a course due to administrative needs, the health and safety of the University community, or government mandates.</p>

<p>Traditional 14-week semesters are offered, plus subterms and an accelerated format. Regardless of the format or delivery, all programs whether online, blended/hybrid, executive weekend, accelerated, subterms or traditional classrooms, must meet the 126-learning hours requirement for a 3-credit course (3 credits * 3 hours/credit * 14 weeks = 126 hours). Adherence to these regulations enhances the quality and rigor of the academic programs and is achieved by utilizing the &#8220;instructional equivalencies&#8221; detailed below.</p>

<p>Faculty establish the learning-based interactions (when, where, how and why) including frequency, duration, evaluation, and assessment techniques. These guidelines recognize the need for the faculty to actively manage the learning space, both inside and outside the classroom. This policy is extremely important in helping faculty in the design and teaching of courses and in student learning. It is the responsibility of the faculty to deliver academic quality regardless of delivery format.</p>

<p>Provided below is an outline of acceptable &#8220;Instructional Equivalencies&#8221;:</p>

<h2><a id="catalog-in-effect" name="catalog-in-effect"></a>Catalog in Effect</h2>

<p>A new student entering the University during the 2025-2026&#160;academic year will be subject to the&#160;academic program requirements contained in this Catalog edition unless the student elects to&#160;complete a revised set of program/concentration requirements published in a future edition of the Catalog.&#160;The student is expected to fulfill the academic requirements in 6 years from the date first enrolled in the program.</p>

<p>A student who elects to complete a revised set of program requirements must notify Records and&#160;Registration of this intent by completing a Change of Program form.</p>

<p>A student who leaves the University and returns from an absence of one year or more will be subject&#160;to the Catalog edition in effect during the year of return.</p>

<h2><a id="enrollment-status" name="enrollment-status"></a>Enrollment Status</h2>

<p>Student enrollment status is defined as either full-time or part-time. The minimum full-time undergraduate student enrollment is 12 semester hours in a semester. Part-time status is any number of credits fewer than 12 semester hours. The full-time course load is 12 through 17 semester hours. A course load average of 15 earned semester hours is needed to complete the program within 4 years.&#160;Requests for a course load greater than 17 semester hours must be submitted to Records and Registration. Students must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 or higher to request an overload.</p>

<p>A degree-seeking student must complete their program of study within 8 years from the date first enrolled in that program or the student may be required to change to the current catalog&#8217;s program requirements. A student cannot pursue more than one degree at a time.</p>

<p>An&#160;F1 student must remain enrolled for a minimum of 12 credit hours per semester. A minimum of 9 credit hours must be in-person format classes. Falling below 12 credit hours or failing to meet in-person class requirements is a violation of F1 status and will result in SEVIS record termination.</p>

<p>Part-time status is sometimes defined further using one of the following terms:</p>

<h2><a id="registration-process" name="registration-process"></a>Registration Process</h2>

<p>Course registration is completed for first-time and transfer students by Records and&#160;Registration. If a student considers a course registration change or increase or reduction in semester&#160;hour load, the student should meet with the academic advisor and complete the Add/Drop procedure.</p>

<p>For subsequent semesters, the student registers on-line at MyHU/Academics to indicate course&#160;selections. The selections are then reviewed by the student&#8217;s academic advisor and finalized when the&#160;student and the advisor agree to the selections. The start and end dates for registration appear on the Academic Calendar and Registration Instructions which are posted on MyHU/Academics and&#160;<a href="http://www.HarrisburgU.edu" target="_blank">www.HarrisburgU.edu</a>.&#160;Students who require an Americans with Disability Act accommodation to complete registration should contact&#160;<a href="mailto:ADA@harrisburgu.edu">ADA@HarrisburgU.edu</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="course-delivery-modes" name="course-delivery-modes"></a>Course Delivery Modes</h2>

<p>In-Person (IP): Required course meetings are delivered in person at a predetermined time and location.</p>

<p>Hybrid (HB): A combination of in-person meetings at a predetermined time and location and synchronous meetings at a predetermined time using virtual classroom technology. The ratio of in-person to virtual instruction is flexible but should be pre-determined.</p>

<p>Synchronous Online (OS): Required course meetings are delivered synchronously at a pre-determined time using virtual classroom technology.&#160;</p>

<p>Asynchronous Online (OA): Courses are entirely online, with no required synchronous course meetings (either in-person or virtual).</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>All required meeting times, both in person and virtual, should be communicated at the point of registration.</li>
	<li>Instructional meetings outside the course modality, if offered, must be optional and/or flexible for students.</li>
	<li>Asynchronous instructional elements may be used in combination with the other three modes without impacting the course delivery definition.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Experiential Learning</h3>

<p>A student who intends to enroll in an experiential project (298 or 498) or internship (365) or applied practice (499) is required to submit an experience request&#160;through Handshake in advance of starting the experience. Once the student&#8217;s request is&#160;received&#160;the designation of an appropriate academic advisor and a site supervisor (if applicable)&#160;is reviewed and approved&#160;by the Office of Career Services &amp; Experiential Learning.&#160;</p>

<p>Additional approval is required for F1 students. F1 students wishing to participate in experiential learning must first consult with the International Student Office to discuss eligibility for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization. Students cannot begin an internship or other experiential learning opportunity until they receive an updated I-20 with CPT authorization.</p>

<h3><a id="directed-studies" name="directed-studies"></a>Directed Studies</h3>

<p>A student requesting a directed study for a course from this catalog must obtain a Directed Study&#160;Request form from Records and Registration. The student must provide a rationale for&#160;requesting the directed study before approval can be granted by Records and&#160;Registration. The&#160;following guidelines are required for a directed study:</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li>
	<p>Directed studies are only open to juniors and seniors.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Directed studies must be necessary. Directed studies are deemed necessary if a student&#160;needs a specific course in their program&#160;in order to graduate that can only be met through&#160;a directed study.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A student must have a minimum GPA of 2.25 in order to request a directed study.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A student may not take more than 6 credits of independent study or directed study from&#160;one faculty member.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The program lead and the student&#8217;s faculty advisor must agree to offer the directed&#160;study.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="add-drop-period-and-course-withdrawals" name="add-drop-period-and-course-withdrawals"></a>Add/Drop Period and Course Withdrawals</h2>

<p><u>Undergraduate</u> - The Add/Drop Period begins on the first day of the semester or subterm and ends after 6 days of classes have occurred (this includes Saturday). A student may make schedule adjustments during the add/drop period on MyHU, or in the&#160;Records and Registration office. No course may be added after the end of this period. If a student withdraws from any course after the conclusion of this period and up until the last day to withdraw from a course with a &#8220;W&#8221;, a final grade of &#8220;W&#8221; will appear on the permanent record. After that period, a &#8220;WF&#8221; will appear on the permanent record. The withdrawal deadlines appear on the Academic Calendar.</p>

<p><u>UPMC Shadyside Nursing Program</u> - The Add/Drop Period begins on the first day of the semester and ends after 14 days of the term. A student may make schedule adjustments during the add/drop period on MyHU, or in the Records and Registration office. No course may be added after the end of this period. If a student withdraws from any course after the conclusion of this period and up until the last day to withdraw from a course with a &#8220;W&#8221;, a final grade of &#8220;W&#8221; will appear on the permanent record. After that period, a &#8220;WF&#8221; will appear on the permanent record. The withdrawal deadlines appear on the Academic Calendar for UPMC&#8217;s Shadyside Nursing Program.</p>

<p>F1 students wishing to drop or withdraw from a course must first consult with the International Student Office to determine eligibility. F1 students must remain enrolled for a minimum of 12 credit hours per semester. A minimum of 9 credit hours must be in-person format classes. Falling below 12 credit hours or failing to meet in-person class requirements is a violation of F1 status and will result in SEVIS record termination.</p>

<h2><a id="audit-policy" name="audit-policy"></a>Audit Policy</h2>

<p>The student may choose to participate in a course on an audit basis. The student who elects this option is expected to attend and participate in class regularly and complete all course requirements. The course that is being audited carries no academic credit but is recorded on the student&#8217;s academic record and will receive a Pass (P) or No Pass (NP) grade at the conclusion of the course. The student who wants to audit a course must notify Records and Registration in writing no later than the end of the Add/Drop Period. The semester hour tuition rate applies to audited courses. An audited course cannot be subsequently taken for credit.</p>

<h2><a id="class-attendance" name="class-attendance"></a>Class Attendance</h2>

<p>Attendance is critical to academic success, and we encourage all students to attend every scheduled class session. Regular attendance is essential for students to fully engage with course materials, participate in classroom discussions, and collaborate with classmates. By attending class consistently, students demonstrate their commitment to their education and are more likely to achieve their academic goals. Therefore, we strongly recommend that all students prioritize attendance and make every effort to attend every class session.</p>

<p>All students are expected to regularly demonstrate academic engagement within each class. It is the instructor&#8217;s responsibility to set forth, in writing, any special conditions regarding absences from the course at the beginning of a course and the impact on student grades. In many classes, participation in class constitutes a substantial part of the work of the course. Faculty should clarify in the class syllabus how students are expected to demonstrate academic engagement.</p>

<h4>Excessive Absences</h4>

<p>When a student fails to participate to such an extent that their own progress or that of the class or group is seriously impaired, they may be at risk of being academically withdrawn from the course.&#160;</p>

<p>If, in the judgment of the instructor, a student is absent consecutively from class for more than two&#160;weeks and fails to complete&#160;the requested participatory assignments:</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li>the instructor will notify the student of this determination;</li>
	<li>the student will have one week to meet with the instructor to address the situation; and</li>
	<li>if the student fails to do so, the instructor will notify Records and&#160;Registration to recommend withdrawing the student from the course.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Online Courses</h4>

<p>Students in an online course must participate in the course weekly, either by submitting assignments or doing discussion posts, quizzes, tests, chats, or team sessions, to be considered in attendance. Logging in and viewing course material is not considered participation. Students that do not participate in their online course within any 14-day period may be administratively withdrawn from their courses.</p>

<h4>F-1 Students - Undergraduate Attendance Policy:&#160;</h4>

<p>United States immigration laws require HU international undergraduate students with F-1 status to be continually enrolled in full-time status. At HU, this requires maintaining a minimum twelve-credit course load in every semester of enrollment (nine of the twelve credits must be 100% in-person courses).</p>

<p>Undergraduate students with F-1 status must attend at least 80% of their in-person classes to maintain their status. Missing 20% or more of in-person classes will be reported to the International Student Office, and the student&#8217;s SEVIS record will be terminated unless there is documented evidence of extenuating circumstances. Submission of documentation does not guarantee the record will not be terminated.</p>

<p>If there is an extenuating circumstance outside of your control that prevents you from meeting the attendance requirement, you must contact the International Student Office in advance: <a href="https://isohelp.harrisburgu.edu/support/home" target="_blank">Support : International Student Office</a>.</p>

<h4>Verification of Enrollment</h4>

<p>At the beginning of each term, Records and Registration verifies the course enrollments of all students. Only students officially registered for a course may attend class. Any student attending class, but not appearing on the roster must be added to the class before the end of the add/drop period. Faculty should notify Records and Registration if a student is in attendance but does not appear on the course roster.</p>

<p>Students must demonstrate academic engagement during the add/drop period.&#160;Failure to participate may result in the course(s) being dropped and the student exited from the program.</p>

<h4>Inclement Weather Notice</h4>

<p>In the event of inclement weather, HU does not post routine delayed openings, early departures, or closures due to weather with local media outlets.</p>

<p>Students, faculty, and staff should dial 717-901-5199 to access HU&#8217;s operating schedule commonly called &#8220;HU Snowline.&#8221; Should HU open late, close early, cancel activities, or close for the day due to inclement weather or for any other emergency, a message will be left on HU&#8217;s voicemail at that number. Additionally, HU will post any changes to its operating schedule on the main page of its website, www.harrisburgu.edu, and update social media outlets.</p>

<p>If HU remains open during or following a weather-related event or other emergency, it is up to each student and employee to make a reasonable decision about whether to travel. Safety and common sense should guide decisions. Students are expected to notify their faculty, and employees are expected to notify their supervisors if they are not reporting to class/work. HU will not make personal calls to students or employees. HU will follow all City of Harrisburg and/or Commonwealth mandated emergency procedures in the event of a weather-related emergency.</p>

<p>Additionally, HU will follow all City of Philadelphia mandated emergency procedures as updated on the Ready Philadelphia/ Office of Emergency Management website: ReadyPhiladelphia | Office of Emergency Management | City of Philadelphia .</p>

<h4>Harrisburg University Unplanned Closure Statement</h4>

<p>When faced with the unplanned physical closure of Harrisburg University (326 Market Street, Harrisburg, PA 17101, and other physical locations) due to inclement weather or other circumstances, it is understood that teaching and learning will continue. Faculty will decide whether course work will be conducted in asynchronous or synchronous (or combined) format, with equal or greater &#8216;learning hours&#8217; to that of the traditional session. Asynchronous format refers to course work that can be done by students independent of the instructor or other students. Synchronous format refers to sessions held in real time involving the students and instructor.</p>

<h2><a id="advanced-standing" name="advanced-standing"></a>Advanced Standing</h2>

<p>A student may earn advanced standing at the University in a variety of ways: transfer of credit from&#160;another institution, the awarding of credit for armed services training, successful prior learning&#160;assessment, or by examination.</p>

<p>A student without a degree who has earned advanced standing is classified on the basis of total&#160;semester hours accepted by the University.</p>

<p>A student who has earned a baccalaureate degree and is working toward a second degree is classified&#160;as a fourth-year student.</p>

<h3>Articulation Agreements or Transfer Credit</h3>

<p>The maximum number of semester hours that may be transferred to the student&#8217;s record is 87; no more than 70 may have been earned at a two-year institution or in a combination of a two-year institution, AP, and CLEP credits. A student must take 33 semester hours (of which a minimum of 15 hours are within the major) at Harrisburg University to meet residency and earn a degree from Harrisburg University. Unofficial or student copies of transcripts may be used to initiate the transfer credit evaluation process. However, official final transcripts from the institution of origin are required before the transfer evaluation process can be finalized by Records and Registration and academic credit is posted to the student&#8217;s permanent record.</p>

<p>Certain 2-year associate degree programs covered under an existing articulation agreement are&#160;accepted into the University&#8217;s baccalaureate degree programs that satisfy the coursework&#160;requirements of the first and second year of study. An unofficial transcript may be used to initiate&#160;this transfer credit process. The official final transcript from the institution of origin reflecting the&#160;degree name and the date the degree was conferred is required to finalize the awarding of coursework&#160;credit or exemption.</p>

<p><strong>Domestic</strong> - In lieu of articulation agreements, academic credit earned at another regionally accredited institution of higher learning&#160;for college-level work is awarded when:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a final grade of &#8220;C&#8221; (not &#8220;C-&#8220;) or higher is earned;</li>
	<li>a course is a reasonable substitute of a University course;</li>
	<li>the course is a reasonable substitute for competencies associated with one of&#160;the general education requirements; and,</li>
	<li>the course is considered college-level work, worthy of elective credit in the&#160;student&#8217;s intended program of study and the student has sufficient unsatisfied&#160;elective credit requirements to which this course may be applied.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>International</strong> - a World Education Services (WES) transcript evaluation,&#160;Educational Credential Evaluation (ECE), or AACRAO&#8217;s Electronic Database for Global Education (EDGE) transcript evaluation is required. If the original evaluation received by Records and Registration from one of these evaluators deems the student&#8217;s prior work to be at the college level and the quality of the completed work is assessed to be at the &#8220;C&#8221; or higher level, credit is awarded for the courses that apply to the student&#8217;s intended program of study at Harrisburg University, as indicated above for domestic transfer credit. If the prior work was earned under an educational system that did not assign credit values, the Harrisburg University semester hour value is assigned for each course being accepted. If the student completed courses that are evaluated to be at the college level, but Harrisburg University has no comparable course(s), the student is granted elective credit unless all required elective credit hours have been satisfied.</p>

<p><strong>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC)</strong> - a massive open online course is an online&#160;course targeting large-scale interactive participation and is delivered via open access on the&#160;web. A MOOC that is successfully completed will be reviewed and considered for transfer&#160;credit.</p>

<p><strong>Coursework at Other Institutions </strong>-<strong> </strong>A student may study at other institutions and transfer&#160;the credit to the student&#8217;s record at Harrisburg University.</p>

<p><u>Process for Approval </u>- The student must complete an Off-Campus Course Request&#160;form at the&#160;Office of Records and Registration notifying the University of the student&#8217;s&#160;intention to enroll on a visiting basis at another higher educational institution. The&#160;request will be reviewed by Records and Registration, which may&#160;consult with an appropriate member of the University&#8217;s faculty. Prior to enrollment,&#160;a written response will be sent to the student stating whether or not the proposed&#160;course is acceptable.</p>

<p><u>Process for Awarding of Credit </u>- The student must arrange for an official transcript&#160;from the other college or university to be sent to Records and&#160;Registration. If the approved course was completed with a final grade of &#8220;C&#8221; or&#160;higher, the semester hours earned from the course will be posted to the student&#8217;s&#160;record as transfer credits and not calculated in the student&#8217;s GPA.</p>

<h3>Armed Services Training Programs</h3>

<p>Under the following conditions, a student may&#160;receive academic credit for training programs completed while serving in the U. S. Armed Services:&#160;1) the student must present a copy of the discharge notice (completed DD-214 form); 2) the&#160;veteran&#8217;s military occupational specialty (MOS) designation must appear on the discharge; and, 3) the&#160;student&#8217;s MOS is described in the American Council on Education&#8217;s <u>Educational Experiences in The&#160;Armed Services volumes 1-3</u>. Credit is awarded based upon the ACE recommendation and the&#160;closeness of the match between the training program and a University course.</p>

<h3>Prior Learning Assessment</h3>

<p>The University may award undergraduate academic credit for&#160;prior knowledge, skills and abilities acquired through non-accredited and work-related learning&#160;experience equivalent to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the outcomes of a specific course; or,</li>
	<li>the outcomes of college-level work not currently offered at the University.</li>
</ul>

<p>The experience and evidence provided should have a direct relation to the material taught in a course in the University&#8217;s curriculum and should extend over a sufficient period to provide substantive knowledge in the relevant area. A baccalaureate degree-seeking student who is in good academic standing, has completed a minimum of 6 semester hours in a program of study at Harrisburg University, and demonstrates the qualities to receive such credit may petition the Provost through the academic advisor for consideration of prior learning assessment.</p>

<p>The petition must include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a detailed description of the relevant experience;</li>
	<li>appropriate supporting evidence;</li>
	<li>the equivalent University program, course number, and title; and,</li>
	<li>the number of semester hours sought.</li>
</ul>

<p>A student may receive a maximum of 18 semester hours of credit for prior learning. However, not&#160;more than 6 semester hours of that credit may be substituted for core courses in the program of&#160;study.</p>

<p>The prior learning assessment process is a way to demonstrate to a mentor, who is an expert in the&#160;field, college-level knowledge in a particular course area. These college-level skills and knowledge&#160;may be from applicable work experience, volunteer activities, training programs, hobbies, religious activities, homemaking skills, prior independent reading or special accomplishments. This process is&#160;not an independent study.</p>

<p>Working with a mentor, the student is guided to develop an online, electronic portfolio to&#160;demonstrate prior college-level learning. The student can choose between standard prior learning&#160;assessment and individualized prior learning assessment. Standard prior learning assessment is an&#160;option when existing course descriptions match the college-level learning that the student wants to&#160;demonstrate. Individualized prior learning assessment occurs when the student proposes a course&#160;description that does not currently exist in the course catalog for&#160;Harrisburg University.</p>

<p>Prior learning assessment cannot be awarded for physical education courses, field experiences, student teaching, cooperative education, practicum courses, internships, projects, seminars, independent study or laboratories. It is important for the student to understand that life and learning experiences alone are an inadequate basis for the award of prior learning credit. To be eligible for prior learning assessment, the outcomes of the non-collegiate learning experience must be documented, be applicable to the student&#8217;s program of study, be related to a course, and be assessed as being similar to or meeting the requirements of learning gained through college-level learning experiences.</p>

<p>Approval of prior learning credit must be made in writing from the academic advisor, the appropriate&#160;faculty member, and the Provost. A per semester hour charge of $225.00 is incurred by the student&#160;for the number of semester hours sought under prior learning assessment.</p>

<p>For more information about prior learning assessment, contact Records and&#160;Registration.</p>

<h3>Credit by Examination</h3>

<p>A student is limited to earning no more than 70&#160;semester hours of&#160;credit via standardized tests: 1) successful performance on an Advanced Placement (AP)&#160;examination; 2) successful performance on a College Level Examination Program (CLEP)&#160;examination; or 3) successful performance on a challenge examination created by the Harrisburg&#160;University faculty.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced Placement (AP)</strong> - a student who participates in the College Entrance Examination Board&#8217;s program in association with secondary schools may earn college credit for this work by: 1) completing the course offered in the secondary school, 2) sitting for the Advanced Placement examination offered in May of each year, and 3) arranging for an official AP score report from College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) to be forwarded to Admissions at <a href="mailto:Transcripts@Harrisburgu.edu">Transcripts@Harrisburgu.edu</a>. See the AP chart indicating the required minimum score for each discipline and the University&#8217;s course equivalencies for which credit may be awarded.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge Examination</strong> - The University awards academic credit to a student who has performed satisfactorily on a challenge examination created by a member of Harrisburg University&#8217;s faculty. A student may do so by obtaining a Challenge Examination Form from Records and Registration, obtain the signature of the sponsoring instructor from the appropriate discipline, pay a fee equal to one-third the normal tuition charge for the course, and return the form to Records and Registration which will schedule a time and location for the examination. If successfully completed, student will receive a &#8220;P&#8221; on transcript.</p>

<h4>Transfer Credit Appeal</h4>

<p>A student who wishes to appeal a transfer credit decision may submit a copy of the syllabus from the course in question to Records and Registration no later than 30 days from the date of the transfer evaluation. Appeals will be reviewed and granted or denied by the program lead and amended on the student&#8217;s record. When cases of unusual or extenuating circumstances occur, a student may appeal the transfer credit decision beyond the 30-day limit.</p>

<h2><a id="off-campus-study-program" name="off-campus-study-program"></a>Off-Campus Study Program</h2>

<p><strong>Pennsylvania Nanofabrication Manufacturing Technology Partnership Capstone&#160;Semester </strong>-&#160;This program is comprised of a 6 course, 18 semester hour, one-semester experience at&#160;The Pennsylvania State University&#8217;s Center for Nanotechnology Education and Utilization on the&#160;University Park Campus focusing on nanofabrication manufacturing technology.</p>

<p><u>Policy</u> - Any biotechnology student who is a Pennsylvania resident may choose to participate&#160;if the following criteria are met: (1) has earned a minimum of 60 semester hours; (2) has&#160;achieved a minimum 2.50 cumulative grade point average; and (3) be in satisfactory financial&#160;standing. The student is enrolled at The Pennsylvania State University during the Capstone&#160;Semester, so all registration, financial aid awards, and tuition payments must be coordinated&#160;with The Pennsylvania State University. If final grades of &#8220;C&#8221; or higher are earned at Penn&#160;State, the academic credit will be posted to the student&#8217;s academic record at Harrisburg&#160;University.</p>

<p><u>Procedure</u> -&#160;The student should express an interest in participating in this program at least&#160;one semester in advance of the desired semester of attendance. The application form is&#160;available on MyHU&gt;Academics&gt;Forms. The student registers for these courses in&#160;Harrisburg University&#8217;s Office of Records and Registration after a letter of acceptance from&#160;The Pennsylvania State University has been received.</p>

<p>Additional information is available in Records and Registration.</p>

<h2><a id="dual-programs" name="dual-programs"></a>Dual Programs</h2>

<p>A student may elect to complete a second program while earning a Bachelor of Science degree. The student must satisfy all of the requirements of both programs. Courses may simultaneously satisfy requirements of both programs, but at least 36 semester hours must be completed unique to the core and concentration of the second program. Biotechnology with a General Biology concentration and Integrative Sciences with a Biology concentration may not be dual programs. The student must complete one additional experiential course, either an Internship or a Project II, in the second program of study, and the Foundation Math requirements for both programs. The student is required to have a minimum GPA of 3.2 and notify Records and Registration in writing of the intention to complete two programs. Dual programs cannot be completed within the minimum 120 semester hours required for a Bachelor of Science degree.</p>

<h2><a id="dual-concentrations" name="dual-concentrations"></a>Dual Concentrations</h2>

<p>A student may elect to complete a second concentration within the program of study. The student must complete both the primary and secondary concentration requirements. The student may simultaneously use one or more courses to satisfy the requirements of both concentrations, but at least four unique courses (a minimum of 3 semester hours each) must be completed toward the second concentration. The Chemistry concentration and the Biochemistry concentration in the Integrative Sciences program&#160;may not be dual concentrations.&#160;The student is required to have a minimum GPA of 3.2 and notify Records and Registration in writing of the intention to complete two concentrations.</p>

<h2><a id="graduation-requirements" name="graduation-requirements"></a>Graduation Requirements</h2>

<p>A student must satisfy all of the following requirements to receive a Bachelor of Science degree:</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li>At least 120 semester hours must be successfully completed.</li>
	<li>The student must successfully complete all of the requirements of the declared program of&#160;study for which the degree is to be awarded.</li>
	<li>A cumulative grade point average of at least 2.00 in <u>all</u> coursework completed at the University is required for graduation from a baccalaureate degree program.</li>
	<li>The program&#8217;s required courses must be completed with a minimum GPA of 2.00.</li>
	<li>A student must earn a minimum of 33 semester hours in residence toward a&#160;baccalaureate degree from Harrisburg University of Science and Technology: 9&#160;semester hours must be completed in experiential courses, 18 semester hours must be&#160;completed in required program courses, and 6 other semester hours. The maximum&#160;number of semester hours that may be transferred to Harrisburg University is 87; no&#160;more than 70 may have been earned at a two-year institution.</li>
</ol>

<p>Verification that the student has met these requirements is made by Records and&#160;Registration. A candidate for graduation must complete <u>all</u> requirements for the degree to be eligible&#160;to participate in Commencement.</p>

<p>A candidate should&#160;apply for graduation after registering for the last semester of the anticipated&#160;completion date by submitting an Application for Graduation via MyHU.&#160;Once degree requirements are met, the degree will be conferred.</p>

<h2><a id="requirements-for-earning-a-second-hu-bachelor-s-degree" name="requirements-for-earning-a-second-hu-bachelor-s-degree"></a>Requirements for Earning a Second HU Bachelor&#8217;s Degree</h2>

<p>A person who has earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree from HU or another accredited college or university may earn a&#160;second bachelor&#8217;s degree by meeting the following requirements:</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li>A student may not pursue a second degree under the same program of study (e.g., if a&#160;student already has earned a B.S. in Computer and Information Systems, the student cannot pursue a second B.S. in Computer and Information Systems). If a student&#160;intends to pursue a different concentration under the same degree, please refer to the&#160;&#8221;<a href="#dual-concentrations">Dual Concentrations</a>&#8221; section of the catalog.</li>
	<li>The student must satisfactorily meet all graduation requirements for the second degree&#160;program unless there is an exception listed below.</li>
	<li>Graduates from HU shall not be required to repeat any general education, foundation,&#160;or seminar course requirements of HU. Graduates who earned their first degree from&#160;another accredited college or university must submit transcripts for audit to determine if&#160;prior coursework meets the General Education and Foundation requirements.</li>
	<li>A minimum of 30 additional undergraduate course semester hours and an additional 6&#160;experiential learning semester hours (i.e., Project II and Internship) must be&#160;successfully completed at HU.</li>
	<li>Coursework completed successfully as part of the first degree program may be used to&#160;satisfy the graduation requirements of the second major but will not count toward the 36&#160;required semester hours minimum.</li>
	<li>A student may not repeat a course&#160;already completed for credit during his or&#160;her first degree program.</li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE: A student currently pursuing a second program at HU does not receive a second degree (please refer&#160;to the &#8220;<a href="#dual-programs">Dual Programs</a>&#8221; section of the catalog). A student who intends to earn a second bachelor&#8217;s degree must&#160;meet all the requirements listed above for the second bachelor&#8217;s degree and must submit a request for a second&#160;bachelor&#8217;s degree to Records and Registration before beginning the second degree.</p>

<h2><a id="finalizing-the-academic-record" name="finalizing-the-academic-record">Finalizing the Academic Record</a></h2>

<p>The university confers degrees at the end of each of the six semesters (Fall, Late Fall, Spring, Late Spring, Summer, and Late Summer). All final grades and&#160;official transcripts&#160;for applicable transfer work must be received&#160;in order for a degree conferral to occur. According to university policy and federal reporting requirements, degrees must be conferred and finalized once a student has fulfilled all requirements.&#160;</p>

<p>Once the degree is conferred, the academic record is considered complete and final. No further changes will be made unless there is a documented clerical error, or the student successfully appeals an academic grievance. It is the responsibility of the student to notify Records and Registration of a clerical error within 30 days of the conferral date.</p>

<p>Course repeats for the purpose of bolstering the final degree GPA are not permitted after a degree is conferred. No transfer work will be accepted after the degree is conferred.&#160;</p>

<p>A student may not retroactively seek to have additional majors or concentrations added to a degree after it has been posted. However, a student may seek readmission as either a non-degree seeking student or as a second degree seeker after their initial degree has been conferred.</p>

<h2><a id="grades-and-grading" name="grades-and-grading"></a>Grades and Grading</h2>

<p>Grades are awarded to each student for academic credit completed. A grade is assigned by the&#160;instructor responsible for the course in which the student is enrolled, using the following grading&#160;scale to indicate the quality of the student&#8217;s academic work.</p>

They are used by the University in circumstances when grades of&#160;&#8220;A&#8221; through &#8220;F&#8221; are not appropriate. A WF grade is calculated into a student&#8217;s GPA.&#160;The credit&#160;type of AD is not included in the calculation of the grade point average.</p>

<p><strong>Audit (AU)</strong> - The audit grade is assigned by the instructor when the student has properly&#160;registered to audit the course and has met all requirements of the University&#8217;s course audit&#160;policy.</p>

<p><strong>Credit (CR)</strong> - A grade of &#8220;CR&#8221; is used to indicate on the student&#8217;s permanent record that&#160;credit has been awarded by the University for military training or successful completion of&#160;an examination. While courses with a &#8220;CR&#8221; grade are counted toward the student&#8217;s degree&#160;requirements, there are no quality points associated with this grade so there is no impact&#160;upon the calculation of the student&#8217;s grade point average.</p>

<p><strong>Incomplete (I)</strong> -&#160;Inability to complete coursework due to documented circumstances beyond the student&#8217;s control (such as severe illness) may, at the instructor&#8217;s discretion, result in a temporary grade of incomplete (I).</p>

<p><strong>Laboratory (LB)</strong> - This grade is assigned by Records and Registration at the&#160;conclusion of a semester to a student who is enrolled in a non-credit developmental&#160;recitation section of a course. This grade and such a course does not appear on the student&#8217;s&#160;transcript.</p>

<p><strong>Withdrawal (W)</strong> - This grade is recorded by Records and Registration when&#160;the student has withdrawn from the course according to the policy set forth by the&#160;University for withdrawing from a course.</p>

<p><strong>Administrative Withdrawal (WA)</strong> - The &#8220;WA&#8221; grade can be assigned only by the Provost&#160;or other designated official. It is used under extenuating circumstances and when the normal&#160;withdrawal process is not available to the student. A request for administrative withdrawal&#160;with accompanying documentation will be submitted to Records and&#160;Registration. The &#8220;WA&#8221; grade can be submitted at any time during the semester.</p>

<p><strong>Withdrawal Fail (WF)</strong> - This grade is recorded by Records and Registration&#160;when the student has withdrawn from the course after the period a student can withdraw&#160;with a &#8220;W&#8221; grade.</p>

<p><strong>Fail - Disciplinary (FD)</strong>&#160;- The &#8220;FD&#8221; grade can be assigned only by the Provost or other designated official. This&#160;grade is used when a student earns a failing grade due to&#160;academic dishonesty.&#160;A request for the FD grade&#160;with accompanying documentation will be submitted to Records and&#160;Registration, at which point the student will be withdrawn from the course. This grade can be submitted at any time during the semester.</p>

<p><strong>Transfer (TR)</strong> - A grade of &#8220;TR&#8221; is used to indicate on the student&#8217;s transcript a block of&#160;credit that has been earned at another institution and that will count toward the degree at&#160;Harrisburg University.</p>

<p><strong>Transfer with Grade Notation (Txx)</strong> - A grade of &#8220;Txx&#8221; is used to indicate on the&#160;student&#8217;s transcript each course that has been successfully completed at another institution&#160;and that has been accepted toward the degree at Harrisburg University.</p>

<p><strong>Not Reported (NR)</strong> - The temporary grade of &#8220;NR&#8221; is recorded by Records&#160;and Registration when the instructor does not report a grade for the student for the course.&#160;Records and Registration will advise the Provost when an &#8220;NR&#8221; grade has&#160;been recorded for the student, and will work with the student and the instructor to&#160;determine why a grade was not reported.</p>

<p><strong>Pass (P)</strong> - The &#8220;P&#8221; grade is assigned by instructors for a student who successfully completes&#160;a course that is designated as a course that will be graded on a Pass/No Pass basis. A &#8220;P&#8221;&#160;grade indicates a grade of C or higher.</p>

<p><strong>No Pass (NP)</strong> - The &#8220;NP&#8221; grade is assigned by the instructors for a student who does not&#160;successfully complete a course that is designated as a course that will be graded on a&#160;Pass/No Pass basis.</p>

<p><strong>Fail-Forgiven (#F)</strong> -&#160; The #F grade is recorded by Records and Registration when a student fails a course that is no longer offered as a course and an equivalent credit-value course substitution is not available for the student to repeat the course.</p>

<p><strong>Prior Learning Assessment (PLA)</strong> - The &#8220;PLA&#8221; grade is used to indicate credit that has&#160;been awarded by the University for prior learning. Although a course completed with a&#160;&#8220;PLA&#8221; grade is applied toward the student&#8217;s degree requirements, no quality points are&#160;associated with this grade so there is no impact upon the calculation of the student&#8217;s grade&#160;point average.</p>

<h3>Grade Point Averages</h3>

<p>A grade point average (GPA) is a statistical calculation of a student&#8217;s performance in a semester. The&#160;semester grade point average summarizes the student&#8217;s performance during that academic term and&#160;the cumulative grade point average (CGPA) summarizes the student&#8217;s performance during all&#160;semesters completed at the University. All credit-bearing courses completed by the student are calculated into the student&#8217;s CGPA.</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li>Compute the quality points earned for each course by multiplying the semester hours&#160;attempted for the course by the numerical value of the grade earned in the course. <em>Example:</em>&#160;<em>A student registered for a course worth 6 semester hours who earns a final grade of &#8220;C&#8221; in that course will&#160;earn 12 quality points for that course (6 semester hours x 2.00).</em></li>
	<li>Add quality points earned for each course in which the student is registered in the&#160;semester.</li>
	<li>Add the number of semester hours attempted for all courses in which a grade of &#8220;A&#8221;&#160;through &#8220;F&#8221; and &#8220;WF&#8221; was earned.</li>
	<li>Divide the total number of quality points earned by the total number of semester hours&#160;attempted. The result is the grade point average for the semester.</li>
</ol>

<p>The cumulative grade point average (CGPA) is determined in a similar way using the cumulative&#160;attempted semester hours and cumulative quality points earned. GPA and CGPA are truncated to&#160;the hundredths.</p>

<h3>Incomplete Grade</h3>

<p>A grade of Incomplete (I) is a discretionary decision. The guidelines for incomplete grades are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Incomplete Grade may be assigned if the student&#8217;s work is of non-failing quality and there is a reasonable likelihood that the student will complete the course material.</li>
	<li>The student must have extenuating circumstances such as illness, accident, serious personal problems, etc.</li>
	<li>The deadline for submitting the outstanding work is up to the discretion of the instructor, but it must be before the end of the add/drop period of the subsequent semester.</li>
	<li>Once the outstanding work has been submitted, the faculty must submit a Change of Grade Form to Records and Registration for the grade to be updated.</li>
	<li>If the outstanding work is not submitted by the end of the add/drop period of the subsequent semester, the instructor should submit a Change of Grade Form so that the grade is changed from the I grade to the grade earned in the course.&#160;</li>
	<li>If the instructor fails to submit the change of grade form one week after the end of the add/drop period of the subsequent semester, Records and Registration will convert the Incomplete grade to an F.</li>
	<li>If a student needs additional time to submit the work after the add/drop period of the subsequent semester ends, they must submit a Petition for Extension of Coursework for Incomplete Grade. This form can be obtained from Records and Registration by submitting a ticket to <a href="https://reghelp.harrisburgu.edu" target="_blank">https://reghelp.harrisburgu.edu</a>. Students will need to work with faculty to complete the form and obtain approval for the extension. The completed and signed form must be sent to Records and Registration for approval.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="early-warning" name="early-warning"></a>Early Warning</h2>

<p>Each instructor notifies Records and Registration of a student&#8217;s poor academic&#160;performance in a course by submitting early warning deficiencies of &#8220;C-&#8220;, &#8220;D+&#8221;, &#8220;D&#8221;, &#8220;F&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8221; at&#160;the end of the fifth week of classes, as indicated on the Academic Calendar. The student is notified&#160;of the deficiency in writing. A student who receives a five-week early warning is encouraged to&#160;consult with the instructor and academic advisor and seek assistance offered by the Office of&#160;Student Success.</p>

<h2><a id="deferred-examination-policy" name="deferred-examination-policy"></a>Deferred Examination Policy</h2>

<p>This section applies to all examinations, including mid-term and take-home examinations, whether or&#160;not administered during the final examination period.</p>

<h3>No Right to Defer</h3>

<p>No student has a right to defer an examination. A student who fails to take an examination when&#160;scheduled will receive a failing grade of &#8220;F&#8221; on the examination unless the examination has been&#160;deferred according to the procedure outlined in this policy.</p>

<h3>Policy on Deferral of Examinations</h3>

<p>Examinations will be deferred only for &#8220;good cause.&#8221; &#8220;Good cause&#8221; will be determined by the&#160;instructor of the course. Examples of &#8220;good cause&#8221; include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>serious personal injury or illness with appropriate documentation;</li>
	<li>serious injury, illness, or death in the immediate family that can be documented; or,</li>
	<li>other extenuating mitigating circumstances beyond the student&#8217;s control.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Procedure for Requesting Deferred Examination</h3>

<p>If a student desires to request deferral of an examination, the student shall file a timely request with&#160;the instructor. Each student requesting deferral of an examination must provide evidence of the&#160;event or situation that&#160;the student believes is justification for the deferral request.</p>

<h3>Emergency Deferral of Examination</h3>

<p>If a student is unable to take an examination for good cause (as defined previously) that arises within&#160;24 hours immediately prior to the examination time, the student may appear in person, communicate&#160;by electronic mail, or telephone the instructor and the Office of Student Success&#160;to obtain&#160;permission to defer an examination.</p>

<p>If a student cannot appear in person, communicate by electronic mail, or by telephone, the student&#160;may miss the examination and apply for a deferral after the examination date. Such application for&#160;deferral must be made to the instructor within 24 hours of the administration of the examination for&#160;which the student seeks the deferral.</p>

<h3>Timing of Make-up Examination</h3>

<p>The deferred examination will be taken at a time determined by the instructor, in conjunction with&#160;the student. The make-up examination must be completed in no more than five (5) business days&#160;after the original test date. Make-up examinations for documented emergencies can be arranged to be&#160;proctored through the Office of Student Success&#160;by emailing <a href="mailto:exams@harrisburgu.edu">exams@harrisburgu.edu</a> or through&#160;the faculty member directly.</p>

<h3>Illness During an Examination</h3>

<p>If a student becomes ill during an examination and is unable to continue, the student shall notify the&#160;proctor and leave all examination materials with the proctor. The student shall seek medical attention&#160;immediately and obtain medical documentation describing the illness that prevented the student&#160;from completing the examination. The student will be permitted to complete the exam at a time&#160;determined by the instructor, no more than five (5) business days after the original test date.</p>

<h2><a id="final-examination-policy" name="final-examination-policy"></a>Final Examination Policy</h2>

<p>Final exams are administered over a three-day period for the Fall and Spring semesters, and a one-day period for the summer semester&#160;following the last day of the semester. A final&#160;exam schedule is distributed during week 8 of the semester, reflecting those courses for which a 2-hour final exam period was requested. Courses not listed on the final exam schedule typically have a&#160;project, oral presentation, or term paper as the final grade assessment.</p>

<h3>Conflicting Exams</h3>

<p>Students are responsible for reviewing their final exam schedule, which is available 8 weeks after the start of the semester. If a student has two final exams scheduled at the same time, it is the student&#8217;s responsibility to notify the instructors of both courses and the Records and Registration Office. The student will work with the instructors and the Records and Registration Office to coordinate a solution.</p>

<h2><a id="final-grading-process" name="final-grading-process"></a>Final Grading Process</h2>

<p>After the conclusion of each semester, the&#160;instructor notifies Records and Registration of&#160;a student&#8217;s academic performance in a course by entering grades via MyHU. Records&#160;and Registration make&#160;these grades available on MyHU according to the dates noted on the&#160;Academic Calendar posted on MyHU.</p>

<h2><a id="final-grade-appeal" name="final-grade-appeal"></a>Final Grade Appeal</h2>

<p>A final grade is assigned by the instructor upon completion of coursework to earn credit during a&#160;semester or other term. A student who disagrees with the final grade assigned by the instructor&#160;should first contact the faculty member directly to resolve the grade dispute informally. The student&#160;that cannot approach the faculty member because of perceived discrimination, cannot reach the&#160;faculty member, or has&#160;received a response with which the student still disagrees, may seek remedy&#160;using an evidence-based argument, with any supplemental documentation, within five (5) days after grades are posted on one of the&#160;following grounds:</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li><u>Discrimination:</u> defined as unfair treatment or assignment of grade on the basis of race,&#160;religion, national origin, sex, age, ancestry, handicapped status, gender identity, sexual&#160;orientation, or political affiliation.</li>
	<li><u>Capricious evaluation:</u> defined as a significant or unjustified departure from grading&#160;procedures outlined in the course syllabus or by the University or arbitrary assignment of&#160;grades. Capricious evaluation cannot be claimed if a student merely disagrees with the&#160;subjective evaluation of the instructor.</li>
	<li><u>Errors:</u> including clerical errors or errors in grade calculations that can be demonstrated in&#160;an objective manner.</li>
</ol>

<p>A student who chooses to appeal a grade must email the Office of Student Success at <a href="mailto:studentsuccess@harrisburgu.edu">studentsuccess@harrisburgu.edu</a>&#160;with an explanation forming the basis of the&#160;appeal.&#160;All documentation for the appeal should be attached in an organized manner with a detailed explanation of the rationale for the appeal. A final grade appeal must be initiated on or before the fifth (5th) business day after grades&#160;are posted, or other terms as specified in the Academic Calendar posted on MyHU.</p>

<p>The Office of Student Success&#160;will review the Final Grade Appeal. The Office of Student Success&#160;may ask for additional information for the student, instructor, or program lead and will access Canvas to verify any student submissions or faculty comments.</p>

<ul style="margin-left:40px">
	<li>If the original final grade is improved and satisfies the student&#8217;s appeal, the instructor or program lead shall submit a Grade Change Form to Records and Registration, the grade&#160;will be posted, and the academic record hold status will be released.</li>
	<li>If the original final grade is reaffirmed and both the instructor and student agree with&#160;the grade determination, Office of Student Success&#160;will notify Records and Registration confirming the original grade.</li>
	<li>If the Office of Student Success&#160;upholds the original grade, the student may request a review of the grade appeal investigation report by the Office of the Provost in email to <a href="mailto:studentsuccess@harrisburgu.edu">studentsuccess@harrisburgu.edu</a>. The determination by the Provost or designee will be final.</li>
	<li>If a student would like to appeal a grade during the semester, students should approach&#160;the faculty member to resolve this informally. All documentation should be saved. If at the&#160;time the final grades is insufficient, the student can file a formal appeal at that time.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="release-of-grades" name="release-of-grades"></a>Release of Grades</h2>

<p>In accordance with the requirements of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA),&#160;reports of the student&#8217;s grades are not routinely sent to the student&#8217;s parents or guardians. The parent&#160;or guardian of a student in our high school programs may obtain grades by writing to Records and Registration. The grades of a student over 18 years of age will be sent to the parents only with the written&#160;consent of the student.</p>

<h2><a id="repeated-courses" name="repeated-courses"></a>Repeated Courses</h2>

<p>A student may repeat a course in which a final grade of C- or below was received. The original grade&#160;remains on the student&#8217;s academic record. After a course has been repeated, the most recent grade is&#160;used in the calculation of the student&#8217;s cumulative grade point average. A student cannot repeat a&#160;course for the sole purpose of improving the overall GPA if the degree requirement has already been&#160;met.</p>

<h2><a id="course-substitutes" name="course-substitutes">Course Substitutes</a></h2>

<p>In situations where a student&#8217;s progression may be impacted or a course substitution may align with the student&#8217;s research or career development, a faculty advisor may request a course substitution.</p>

<p>Course substitutions for Experiential Learning requirements, would need to meet the appropriate designated Experiential Learning course options which have been approved by Curriculum Committee.</p>

<p><strong>Guidelines for Consideration</strong></p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
	<li>The student is expected to satisfy the requirements of the declared program of study and all other required University degree requirements for the academic year the student is pursuing as a degree candidate.</li>
	<li>The course to be substituted should be in the same area as the required course or in a closely related area.</li>
	<li>Substitution of a course for a previously failed required course is seldom granted.</li>
	<li>Failure to schedule a required course is not sufficient reason for granting permission for a course substitution.</li>
	<li>Student must have successfully completed or be in progress of the course being considered for substitution.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Steps for Requesting Course Substitution&#160; </strong></p>

<ol start="1">
	<li>Initiation of Request
	<ul>

	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="academic-honors" name="academic-honors"></a>Academic Honors</h2>

<p><strong>Honors List</strong> A student is eligible for the Honors List at the conclusion of the fall and spring semesters when:</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li>the semester grade point average is 3.50 or higher; and,</li>
	<li>a minimum of 9 semester hours of coursework was completed, excluding those courses in&#160;which final grades were earned that are not included in the calculation of the grade point&#160;average.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Graduation Honors&#160;</strong>A student who has earned consistently superior grades will be recognized for&#160;this achievement at graduation with the designation listed below representing the student&#8217;s level of&#160;achievement. Both the student&#8217;s diploma and university record will carry the appropriate honors&#160;designation as follows:</p>

<p><em>Summa Cum Laude</em> for a cumulative grade point average between 3.95 and 4.00<br />
<em>Magna Cum Laude</em> for a cumulative grade point average between 3.75 and 3.94<br />
<em>Cum Laude</em> for a cumulative grade point average between 3.50 and 3.74</p>

<h2><a id="academic-standing-policy" name="academic-standing-policy"></a>Academic Standing Policy</h2>

<p>A student with a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of 2.0 or higher at the end of the semester is in satisfactory academic standing. A student with a CGPA below 2.00&#160;at the end of a semester is not in satisfactory academic standing and is subject to warning, probation, or dismissal according to the&#160;following policy:</p>

<h4 style="margin-left:40px">First Occurrence - Warning</h4>

<p style="margin-left:40px">Following the first semester in which the student does not meet the satisfactory academic&#160;progress standard, the student will automatically be placed on academic warning for the next&#160;semester. A letter will be issued advising the student of their academic warning status. No&#160;appeal is needed, but in consultation with the Office of Student Services, an academic plan&#160;may be required.</p>

<h4 style="margin-left:40px">Second Consecutive Occurrence - Probation</h4>

<p style="margin-left:40px">If, by the end of the warning semester, the student is not able to achieve satisfactory&#160;academic progress status, a letter will be issued placing the student on academic probation&#160;status for the next semester. An academic plan is required during the probation semester.&#160;The student should work with the Office of Student Success&#160;to create the academic plan.</p>

<h4 style="margin-left:40px">Third Consecutive Occurrence - Dismissal</h4>

<p style="margin-left:40px">If a student after three consecutive semesters has a cumulative grade point average that&#160;remains below 2.00 or fails to meet the program pursuit percentage, a letter of dismissal will&#160;be issued.</p>

<p>If an F-1 student is academically dismissed from Harrisburg University, their SEVIS record will be terminated.</p>

<h3>Failure to Make Academic Progress</h3>

<p>A student that fails to make any academic progress and have a cumulative GPA of 0.00 after two semesters will be dismissed and have the opportunity to appeal as outlined below.</p>

<h3>Dismissal Appeals</h3>

<p>A student who is dismissed as a result of failure to meet satisfactory academic progress may file an academic appeal by submitting a letter outlining the nature of the appeal to the Office of Student Success&#160;within five (5) days of notification. An appeal will be considered only if the student&#8217;s failure to meet the standards of academic progress is determined to be due to events beyond the student&#8217;s control. Examples of circumstances for which an appeal may be considered include military obligation; death of a relative; injury or illness of the student; unusual personal hardship or other extenuating circumstances. Written documentation of the circumstances of why the student failed to make satisfactory progress and what has changed that will allow the student to make satisfactory progress by the next evaluation must be submitted with the appeal and should reference the student&#8217;s name and student ID number. In addition, the evidence must be received documenting that the required academic plan was completed, the cumulative grade point average has improved, and the required satisfactory progress grade point average can potentially be achieved to complete a program of study within the maximum timeframe&#160;limitation. Appeals submitted without documentation will not be considered. A timely determination will then be made and documented in the student&#8217;s file.</p>

<p>If the academic appeal is denied, a second notice will be sent to the student advising that their appeal&#160;was denied. If the academic appeal is approved, a semester of academic probation will be awarded,&#160;and the student will be notified in writing that their appeal was approved. The student must achieve&#160;satisfactory academic progress by the end of the probation semester.</p>

<p>If after the academic probation semester, a student is still not making satisfactory academic progress,&#160;but the evidence is provided showing the academic plan was successfully executed, the cumulative grade&#160;point average has improved, and the required satisfactory academic progress grade point average can&#160;potentially be achieved within the maximum time frame limitation required by federal regulations&#160;then a second probation semester may be granted.</p>

<h2><a id="withholding-of-records" name="withholding-of-records"></a>Withholding of Records</h2>

<p>Student records may be withheld by Records and Registration when directed by the&#160;appropriate University officials.&#160;More specifically, the student&#8217;s&#160;diploma&#160;will not be released, and a student cannot register for courses if&#160;tuition or other charges remain unpaid to the University. Additionally, a student may not be able to register for courses while the hold is on their record. The Office of Student Services&#160;determines when&#160;a student&#8217;s record should be placed on hold for disciplinary reasons, and the Business Office&#160;determines when a student&#8217;s record should be placed on hold for financial reasons.</p>

<h2><a id="official-withdrawal-from-the-university-procedure" name="official-withdrawal-from-the-university-procedure"></a>Official Withdrawal from the University Procedure</h2>

<p>A student is encouraged to contact the Financial Aid and Business Offices in advance of any decision&#160;to withdraw from the University to obtain an explanation of the tuition and financial aid adjustments&#160;that will occur, if any, as the result of withdrawal from the program of study.</p>

<p>A student on an F-1 Visa should contact the International Student Office prior to submitting a withdrawal form to understand the impact it may have on their SEVIS status.</p>

<p>A student who intends to officially withdraw is encouraged to contact the Records and&#160;Registration Support Portal at <a href="https://reghelp.harrisburgu.edu">https://reghelp.harrisburgu.edu</a>&#160;or in person. A&#160;withdrawal form should be completed. The determination date for withdrawal purposes shall be the actual date of formal notification by the student unless other evidence is provided to Records and Registration. The determination date is used to calculate the tuition refund,&#160;if any, and the student financial assistance program refund, if applicable.&#160;Withdrawn courses cannot be reinstated.&#160;</p>

<h3>Military Personnel Called to Active Duty Policy</h3>

<p>If a student is called to active duty by the National Guard or the reserve forces of the United States during an active semester, they should provide documentation of their call to active duty to the &#160;Certifying Official. The below procedure will then apply: &#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">1. Course Registration/Grades: The student will be given the option to have courses dropped or an &#8220;I&#8221; (Incomplete) grade assigned to each of their courses. The assigning of an &#8220;Incomplete&#8221; is by mutual consent of the faculty member and the student and an appropriate completion date are to be assigned. If the active duty call occurs late in the term, the faculty member also has the option of assigning a final grade rather than the &#8220;I&#8221; grade. &#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">2. Tuition: Tuition charges will be canceled or refunded in full‐ for all courses dropped. Courses in which the grade of &#8220;I&#8221; or a final grade is assigned will have applicable tuition assessed. The student must coordinate with the Certifying Official to address any overpayment or other&#160;financial considerations with Veterans Administration funding &#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">3. Housing: If the student resides in campus housing, they should initiate a discussion with Residence Life Staff. &#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">4. Student Record: &#160;The Student record will be kept active for one year from the later of the following dates, after which the student would be eligible for re‐admission: ‐ Effective date of dropped course(s) ‐ End of the final completed semester ‐ Latest deadline of assigned &#8220;I&#8221; grade&#160;</p>

<h3>Medical Withdrawal</h3>

<p>A student requesting to withdraw for medical reasons must complete a medical leave request through the Office of Student Success&#160;by contacting <a href="mailto:studentservices@harrisburgu.edu">StudentServices@harrisburgu.edu</a>. Student Success&#160;will obtain official documentation from a doctor supporting the student&#8217;s request. To return from medical leave, the student must provide student services with documentation from a doctor supporting the student&#8217;s return. The student will have up to a year to return without having to apply for readmission.</p>

<p>An F1 student wishing to drop or withdraw from a course for medical reasons must first consult with the International&#160;Student Office for options.</p>

<h2><a id="unofficial-withdrawal" name="unofficial-withdrawal">Unofficial Withdrawal</a></h2>

<p>A student who discontinues attendance in all courses during a semester and does not officially withdraw from the University is considered to have unofficially withdrawn. The determination date for unofficial withdrawals shall be the end of the semester unless other evidence is provided to Records and Registration. Federal student financial aid program implications for a student who unofficially withdraws can be provided by the Financial Aid Office.</p>

<p>An F1 student who unofficially withdraws will have their SEVIS record terminated immediately.&#160;</p>

<p>Harrisburg University expects a student to act honorably and in accordance with the standards of&#160;academic integrity. Academic integrity is grounded in mutual trust and respect. Therefore, it is&#160;expected that a student will respect the rights of others and will only submit work that is their own,&#160;refraining from all forms of lying, cheating, and plagiarism.</p>

<p>A violation of the Standards of Academic Integrity could result in academic consequences. Please see&#160;the <a href="https://www.harrisburgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/Student-HandbookPublishedAugust172021.pdf">Student Handbook</a> for details about academic conduct and the procedures in cases of a violation of Harrisburg University&#8217;s&#160;Standards of Academic Integrity.</p>

<h2><a id="disciplinary-academic-dismissal" name="disciplinary-academic-dismissal"></a>Disciplinary/Academic Dismissal</h2>

<p>The University reserves the right to exclude at any time a student who has misrepresented any part of his or her admission materials, whose academic record is unsatisfactory, or whose behavior or conduct is found to be detrimental to the orderly functioning of the University. When misconduct may constitute a threat to a person or property within the University community or under other circumstances, it may result in disciplinary action. The University assumes the responsibility to regulate the private conduct of the student when such conduct could constitute a hazard to or an infringement on the rights of others, a violation of the law, of University policy or instructions, or is a disruption of the legitimate academic and administrative processes of the University. Please see the <a href="https://www.harrisburgu.edu/wp-content/uploads/Student-HandbookPublishedAugust172021.pdf">Student Handbook</a>,&#160;available at&#160;<a href="https://myhu.harrisburgu.edu/ics" target="_blank">https://myhu.harrisburgu.edu/ics</a>, for details on the policies regarding the Student Code of Conduct, the Academic Code of Conduct, or Sexual Misconduct Policies.&#160;</p>

<p>If an F-1 student is dismissed from Harrisburg University, their SEVIS record will be terminated.</p>
