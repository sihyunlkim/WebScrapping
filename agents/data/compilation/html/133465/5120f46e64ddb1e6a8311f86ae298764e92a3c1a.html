However, South University reserves the right to modify programs, which are subject to change at its discretion. Under certain circumstances, such as change in program of study, students may request a course substitution to satisfy a previous course requirement.</span></p><p><span>For South University students who change programs or re-enter in a previously enrolled program within two years of a program modification, a course substitution request will only be considered if the student's last date of attendance (LDA) is within two years of re-entry/readmissions.</span><em><span><strong>&nbsp; </strong></span></em><span>All substitution considerations must be for the South University courses from the previous program to apply toward the current program requirements.</span></p><p><span>All course substitution requests need to be made by submitting a Course Substitution Form. Students should submit the form to their Academic Counselor, who will forward the form to the appropriate Program Director (or Department Chair when Program Director is not present) for consideration. &nbsp;The Program Director (or Department Chair when Program Director is not present) will then forward the request and recommendation to the Department Chair (or Assistant/Associate Dean if Program Director is not present) for approval. All requests will have two signatures, one for recommendation and one for approval.&nbsp; Substitutions for General Education courses will be reviewed by the appropriate General Education Program Director and Department Chair.</span></p><p><span>Course substitutions not recommended by the Program Director or Department Chair, may be appealed to the Department Chair or Assistant/Associate Dean. Course substitutions denied by the Department Chair may be appealed to the College/School Dean or designee. The decision of the College/School Dean is final.</span></p><h2 id="prerequisite-coursework-policy-844">Prerequisite Coursework Policy</h2><p>The determination of the suitability of particular required prerequisite coursework will be made by the program director in consultation with the Chair of the Department in which the program is based. Coursework will be deemed acceptable if it meets the following criteria:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Content and comparability relative to standard college/university coursework in the specific discipline of the required courses as determined by the program Director or designee</li><li>Science courses must have been completed within 7 years before the date of matriculation</li><li>Coursework must be from an acceptable accredited collegiate institution that possesses either regional or national accreditation granted by an agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education</li><li>Coursework from Non-U.S. institutions will be considered if the coursework is evaluated by an accredited agency that can provide a statement of equivalency between foreign coursework and standard college/university coursework, including grades (e.g. Educational Credential Evaluators, Inc.), and that is acceptable to South University</li><li>Coursework must be successfully completed for credit, with an appropriate grade greater than or equal to a C-&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 id="change-of-program-395">Change of Program</h2><p>A student may change their program at any point of their enrollment provided that they are in good satisfactory academic standing. Changing from an associate's degree to a bachelor's degree in the same program is not considered a change of program. &nbsp;Changing from one specialization or emphasis within a program to another specialization or emphasis within the same program is not considered a change of program. &nbsp;The Senior Academic Progress and Remediation Specialist, or designee may grant exceptions to students on Academic/Financial Aid Warning or Probation. Only then will a student to be allowed the opportunity of changing from one program to another.</p><p>Courses that apply to the subsequent program will be recorded as earned credit and will affect the student's Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). For Incremental Completion Rate (ICR) purposes, earned credit applied to the new program will reduce the total number of credits that must be attempted within the program. Therefore, the maximum allowable credits are one and one half times the number of credits remaining to complete for graduation. Students who change programs and students who change session times within the same program must sign a new program enrollment form (or the like), which must be filed in the student's academic file.</p><p>Students must contact their Academic Counselor to change their program.</p><p>A course required in a student's initial program that is not required in the student's subsequent program may have a negative impact on a student's financial aid. Therefore, students should consult with Student Financial Services before changing their program.</p><h2 id="physical-therapist-assistant-pta-program-change-policy--812">Physical Therapist Assistant (PTA) Program Change Policy&nbsp;</h2><ul><li>South University students in good standing may transfer into the General Education Phase of the Physical Therapist Assistant (PTA) program from another South University program if they meet the PTA minimum standards for academic and financial aid progress as outlined in the Academic Catalog at the time of transfer.</li></ul><h2 id="program-change-from-nursing-rn-to-bsn-to-rn-to-master-of-science-in-nursing-rn-to-msn--638">Program Change from Nursing (RN to BSN) to RN to Master of Science in Nursing (RN to MSN)&nbsp;</h2><p><em>Note: Not all Online Program offerings are available to residents of all U.S. states.
