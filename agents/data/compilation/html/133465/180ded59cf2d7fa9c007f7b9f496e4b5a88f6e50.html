Please review the University Attendance Policy for more information.</p><p>If classes are not canceled despite inclement weather, students are responsible for any academic work they miss as a result of the weather. &nbsp;</p><p>Students may sign up for My CampusAlert by following instructions provided via the welcome e-mail from Rave Mobility.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="immunization-policy-821">Immunization Policy</h2><p>South University recognizes all state and federal vaccination and immunization requirements and is responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable requirements. &nbsp;The state specific immunization requirements are listed below. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Institutional Vaccination Requirements:&nbsp;</strong><br>Some South University programs have additional immunization requirements. &nbsp;Prospective and current students should review the admission requirements for the educational program of their choice for the institutional requirements. &nbsp;In addition, if applicable, the Programmatic Student Handbooks includes information for the maintenance of immunizations during enrollment.</p><p><strong>State Vaccination Requirements:&nbsp;</strong><br><em>Alabama</em> &nbsp;<br>The state in which the institution is located currently does not require students to have any specific vaccination to attend the school.</p><p><em>Florida</em>&nbsp;<br>The information provided below complies with Florida Statute § 1006.69, which requires the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Provide detailed information concerning the risks associated with meningococcal meningitis and hepatitis B and the availability, effectiveness, and known contraindications of any required or recommended vaccine to every student, or to the student’s parent if the student is a minor, who has been accepted for admission.</li></ul><p><em>Georgia</em> &nbsp;<br>The information provided below complies with Chapter 12 of Title 31 of the Official Code of Georgia, §31-12-3.2, which requires the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Provide information to each newly matriculated new student or any newly matriculated student residing in school sponsored housing about meningococcal disease and the availability of vaccination,</li><li>Require students to return a form confirming receipt of the information and indicating their choice regarding immunization.</li></ul><p><em>North Carolina&nbsp;</em></p><ul><li>All students enrolling in a campus in North Carolina must provide proof of immunization as required by North Carolina law. Students must provide the required immunization records within 10 weeks of their start date. Failure to provide the appropriate documentation may result in student being unable to register for class.</li></ul><p><em>South Carolina &nbsp;</em><br>The state in which the institution is located currently does not require students to have any specific vaccination to attend the school.</p><p><em>Texas</em> &nbsp;<br>The state in which the institution is located currently does not require students to have any specific vaccination to attend the school.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Virginia</em> &nbsp;<br>The state in which the institution is located currently does not require students to have any specific vaccination to attend the school.</p><p><strong>Federal Vaccination Recommendations and Requirements:</strong></p><p><strong>Vaccination Recommendations for College Students&nbsp;</strong><br>On February 10, 2005, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) voted to recommend that all incoming college freshmen living in dormitories be vaccinated against meningococcal disease. The ACIP also recommended vaccination for all adolescents at high school entry and during pre-adolescent health care visits (11 to 12 years old). &nbsp;</p><p>The American College Health Association (ACHA) issued similar immunization recommendations for all first-year students living in residence halls. The ACIP and ACHA recommendations further state that other college students under 25 years of age may choose to receive meningococcal vaccination to reduce their risk for the disease.</p><p>ACHA and ACIP recommendations, coupled with the availability of a new vaccine that may provide longer duration of protection, will help increase rates of immunization against meningococcal disease and will give college health professionals the guidance needed to help protect college students against meningococcal disease.</p><h2 id="student-email-communication-policy-906">Student Email Communication Policy</h2><p>South University will provide all applicants and current students a <a>southuniversity.edu</a> email account. &nbsp;This will be considered the student's primary email account while enrolled at South University. All email communication from the University will be sent to the primary email account; however, students may also add a secondary email account to their record. Students will also receive official college communications via web alert and text messaging. &nbsp;Students have the preference of opting out of text communication.</p><h2 id="code-of-conduct-378">Code of Conduct</h2><p>Each student who enters South University commits, by the act of enrolling, to full acceptance of the University Code of Conduct. For ease of reference, the Student Handbook contains the Code of Conduct, disciplinary procedures, and the appeals process.</p><p>Professors are not expected to jeopardize the progress of a class by permitting the continued presence of any student whose behavior in any way could adversely affect the class. Inappropriate behavior includes disruptive behavior, or other actions that are not considered proper conduct for a university student. The Code of Conduct also applies to inappropriate actions on campus outside of the actual classroom or while participating in University sponsored activities off campus. The Code of Conduct also applies to online activities that occur on South University websites.</p><p>Alleged violations of the conduct code will be referred to the Dean of Student Affairs. See the Disciplinary Procedures section of the Student Handbook for specific details. Violations of the code of conduct may result in disciplinary probation, suspension or dismissal (for students who are dismissed and are receiving VA benefits, their benefits will be terminated as of the date of their dismissal). A full copy of the code of conduct is available in the South University Student Handbook.</p><h2 id="general-complaint-procedures-955">General Complaint Procedures</h2><p>If you have a complaint or problem, you are encouraged to follow this procedure:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>You should discuss complaints with the individual(s) within the appropriate department.

In the event that institutional processes do not result in a successful resolution of a complaint, NDUS is responsible for final resolution of any such complaints originating at any authorized, exempted, or SARA participant institution, public or private. Conversely, if you are a North Dakota resident attending a distance education program at a SARA institution in another state, you will need to begin the complaint process at the institution you attend.
