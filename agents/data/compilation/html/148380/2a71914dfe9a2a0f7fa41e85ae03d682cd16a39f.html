<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>

		
		<h5>What contact information do I need to enter into the system?</h5> 
		<p>The system allows you to enter up to six phone numbers and two e-mail addresses. Only one phone/device can be designated to receive text (SMS) alerts. When registering, you will see a separate field where you can specify the mobile device you want to use to receive text alerts. All other phone numbers you provide will receive voice calls in an emergency.</p>
		<h5>What information will I need in order to register?</h5>
		<p>Credit students will need to enter their student number and network password. Non-credit students will need to enter their name and date of birth. Employees will need to enter their employee id number and network password. This information will help us verify that you are a student or employee at RVC.</p>
		<h5>Can my parents sign up for the service? </h5>
		<p>At this time, only registered RVC students are allowed to sign up for the service. However, if you choose to, you may enter parents' or relatives' phone number(s) as part of the six phone numbers you are allowed to enter into the system.</p> 
		<p><em>Note: Parents of Whiz Kids students may sign up for the service by selecting the "Non-Credit" sign-up option and following the proper steps.</em></p> 
		<h5>Will I receive unwanted messages or advertisements as part of this service?</h5>
		<p>
		NO. The system will be used in emergencies only. Periodically, the system will be tested and you will be warned of these system tests in advance via your student e-mail.
		If you choose to receive non-emergency notifications you will receive those text alerts as well. These notifications will occur a few times each semester and will only be 
		used to remind you of important dates and deadlines regarding registration, payment, and financial aid. You must opt-in to receive non-emergency notifications by clicking 
		the appropriate box on the sign-up page.
		</p>
		<h5>What about weather-related closings/cancellations?</h5>
		<p>YES! Weather-related closings and cancellations will be considered an emergency situation and students who sign up for the service will be notified of campus closings via this alert system.</p>
		<h5>Does this service cost me anything?</h5>
		<p>Standard text messaging rates will apply for any text messages received. Cell phone minutes will have to be used to listen to or receive the voice calls. But even with system tests and campus closing alerts, the effect on your usage should be negligible.</p> 
		<h5>What happens if/when I receive an alert message from RVC?</h5>
		<p>Instructions will typically be included in the message, directing you either to the RVC Web site or a hotline number for more detailed information.</p> 
		<h5>What phone number will show up on my caller id?</h5>
		<p>
		The number 815-921-2578 will show up on your caller id for voice calls. Typically the message will instruct you to dial a specific number or direct you to the RVC web site 
		for more information. DO NOT call this number back! The numbers 23177 and 63079 are the numbers you could see displayed when you receive an emergency text message from the 
		system. <em>It is strongly recommended that you program these three numbers mentioned above into your cell phone contacts under the name "RVC Alert."</em> If you also 
		choose to opt-in for non-emergency notifications, you should also program the number 53291 under this new contact on your phone.
		</p>
		<h5>What e-mail address will show up for the e-mail alerts?</h5>
		<p>E-mail alerts will show up in your in-box as originating from <a href="mailto:rvc-alert@rockvalleycollege.edu">rvc-alert@rockvalleycollege.edu</a>. Do not respond to these e-mail messages as you will only receive an auto-response directing you to the RVC Web site for more information. You will not receive a personal response by replying to e-mail alerts.</p>
		<h5>How does the system respond to busy signals or no-answer situations?</h5>
		<p>For busy signals, the call will be repeated several times in an attempt to reach you. The same is true for no-answer or call-waiting. If the phone is answered by a message recorder, the message will be left on the answering device. If after several attempts the call does not successfully go through, the system will stop attempting and report your number to be busy.</p>
		<h5>If I provided multiple phone numbers, e-mail addresses and SMS, which device will receive the message first?</h5>
		<p>The system delivers messages to phones, e-mails, and SMS independently and simultaneously. Messages will be delivered to all of your provided numbers at the same time, meaning your cell phone and work/home phone could ring at the same time. E-mail and SMS deliveries are dependent on your service providers, and in most cases will come across very quickly.</p>
		<h5>How will I be notified of upcoming system tests?</h5> 
		<p>You will receive an e-mail notification in your student e-mail account letting you know of the exact date and approximate time of any scheduled tests of the system. You will also be told what to expect to see in the message and how it will be received (text, voicemail, e-mail, or all of the above).</p> 
		<h5>Can I remove myself from the system?</h5>
		<p>Yes. At any time, simply go to <a href=".">http://www.rockvalleycollege.edu/Alert/</a> and log-in as you did when you signed up for the service. There will be an option at the bottom of the screen to remove your RVC Alert. <em>You can also access your account at any time if you need to edit or update your contact information.</em></p>
		<h5>Will I automatically stop receiving alerts once I stop attending classes or graduate RVC?</h5>
		<p>Yes. You will automatically be removed from the system when you are no longer a registered student at RVC. If you take a semester or more off and return to RVC to take classes, you will NOT have to re-register to begin receiving alerts again.</p>
