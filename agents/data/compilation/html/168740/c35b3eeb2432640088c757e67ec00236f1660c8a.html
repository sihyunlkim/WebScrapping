    <h1>What is Academic Integrity</h1>
    <p>
      What is understood as honesty in completing classwork and tests varies in different education systems. Before you
      begin this class then, it is important that you understand our expectations for respectful learning.

      <h2>Why Does it Matter?</h2>
      <p>
        Andrews University learning thrives on the rigor of individual investigation, the authentic exchange of ideas, a
        corporate commitment to integrity, and faith in action. It requires all members of the academic community to
        behave honestly—speaking truthfully to colleagues, co-learners and teachers and completing all homework, tests,
        papers and projects with integrity. Andrews University anchors its practices in the teachings of the Bible as
        well as in widely-established and honorable academic traditions. Much as the apostle Paul calls us to
        authenticity in our Christian walk, so the educational institution demands of its participants true and accurate
        self-representation. In Ephesians, Paul invites believers “to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to
        clothe yourselves with the new self, created according to the likeness of God in true righteousness and
        holiness” (Eph. 4:23–24, NRSV). As scholars and as Christ’s servants, we build His living body through our
        honesty in all things, both small and great.
