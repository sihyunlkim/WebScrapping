<PRE>Dear Colleagues,

With fall quarter just a little more than a month away, many of you will soon be turning your attention back to teaching. This time last year, generative AI was not something that many of us spent much time thinking about. But with the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022, higher education has been consumed with understanding the potential of this new technology and adapting to its wide availability. Over the past several weeks, a group of academic leaders has developed the attached set of guidelines and suggested practices for using generative AI in instructional settings at UCR. Senate leadership also has been engaged and provided feedback on an earlier draft. Please review this brief document and the embedded links to additional information, and consider how you may want to adapt your courses accordingly. You can also find a copy of the document here&lt;<A HREF="https://provost.ucr.edu/resources">https://provost.ucr.edu/resources</A>&gt; on the Provost's website.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Watkins
Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor

Sang-Hee Lee
Chair of the Riverside Division of Academic Senate

Lidia Kos
Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies

Louie Rodriguez
Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education
