<h2>Policy Concerning Violations of Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Students enrolled in the College of Pharmacy who have been disciplined for violation of academic integrity, as described in the current edition of the UNMC Student Handbook, shall be ineligible for the granting or receipt of scholarships, awards, honors, and other special recognitions through the University of Nebraska, the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and/or the College. This ineligibility shall remain in effect throughout the student’s tenure in the professional program.</p>
<p>To preserve student confidentiality, the following procedures will be followed prior to the consideration of students for scholarships and/or awards by the Scholarship, Honors and Financial Aid Committee, and other awards, honors, or other special recognitions by the Dean’s Office. The Dean and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs will have the responsibility for the removal of names of ineligible students from lists used by the Committee or the Dean’s Office to select recipients of scholarships, awards, honors, or other special recognitions. In addition, communities, organizations, or other groups outside of the University seeking verification of academic standing for the purpose of offering a scholarship, award, or honor to a student, will be informed, when a situation exists pursuant to this policy, of the student’s ineligibility.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Scholarships: The list of students eligible for consideration for financial assistance compiled by the Director of the Office of Financial Aid in Student Services will be forwarded by the Director to the Dean of the College of Pharmacy for review. In accordance with this policy, the Dean and Associate Dean for Student Affairs will remove the names of all students ineligible for scholarships prior to forwarding the list to the Committee.</li>
	<li>Awards: The list of students eligible for consideration for awards will be provided by the Dean to the Scholarship, Honors and Financial Aid Committee. In compiling this list, and in accordance with this policy, the Dean and Associate Dean for Student Affairs will remove from pertinent class rosters the names of all students ineligible for consideration for awards.</li>
	<li>Honors: Lists of students under consideration for honors, e.g., The Dean’s List, Graduation with Distinction or High Distinction, etc., shall be reviewed by the Dean and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. In accordance with this policy, the names of all students ineligible to receive such honors will be removed prior to announcement or publication in any College, or campus list, brochure, program, or compendium.</li>
	<li>Other Special Recognitions: Lists of students under consideration for special recognitions, e.g., The National Deans List, etc., shall be reviewed by the Dean and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. In accordance with this policy, the names of all students ineligible to receive such recognitions will be removed prior to announcement or publication in any College, campus, or National list, program, brochure, or compendium.</li>

<h2>Standards of Academic Performance Retention and Promotion Criteria</h2>
<p>Students enrolled full-time in the professional program of the College of Pharmacy are expected to make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of the degree requirements. Satisfactory academic progress is defined as successful completion of the prescribed curriculum in the prescribed time, maintenance of a minimum of a 2.00 semester grade point average (SGPA), professional required course grade point average (PGPA) and accumulative grade point average (AGPA), and completion of any professional deficiencies and/or required remedial courses in the time and manner prescribed by the Faculty of the College of Pharmacy.</p>
<p>Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress in the professional program are placed automatically on academic probation. Students on academic probation may be required to participate in academic counseling and/or to enroll in a remedial program of study, or they may be suspended or dismissed according to the policies described in subsequent sections. Such actions will be recommended by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee, subject to review by the Faculty. Notification of such actions will be made to the student by the Office of the Dean.</p>
<p>The actions taken in these matters are not to be viewed as punitive, but as a recognition that it is unrealistic for a student to continue in a course of study where there is little probability of success. These same Standards will be applied to students enrolled in an approved part-time course of study.</p>
<h2>Academic Probation</h2>
<p>Academic probation is the initial official action for a student failing to make satisfactory academic progress.</p>
<p>A student will be placed on academic probation for:</p>
<ol>
	<li>failure to maintain a minimum semester grade point average (SGPA) of 2.00;</li>
	<li>failure to maintain a professional required course grade point average (PGPA) of 2.00;</li>
	<li>failure to maintain an accumulative grade point average (AGPA) of 2.00;</li>
	<li>a failing grade in a professional required course; and/or</li>
	<li>unauthorized failure to complete any degree requirement at the prescribed time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on the nature of the academic deficiencies and the overall academic record, a student placed on academic probation may or may not be permitted to continue in the regular sequence of the professional curriculum. If a student fails a professional required course, the course must be repeated during the next term in which it is offered. Considerations related to course sequence issues are coordinated via the Academic Performance and Standards Committee.</p>
<p>A student placed on academic probation will normally be given one semester to correct any grade point deficiencies. The Academic Performance and Standards Committee will review the student’s record at the end of the term of probation.</p>
<p>If the SGPA and PGPA for that term are 2.00 or above, and the AGPA is 2.00 or above, the student will be released from academic probation. If the SGPA and PGPA are 2.00 or above, but the AGPA remains below 2.00, the student will remain on academic probation. A student remaining on academic probation for more than two consecutive semesters will be subject to suspension or dismissal.</p>
<p>If a student fails to make satisfactory progress during the period of academic probation, and/or fails to correct academic deficiencies within the prescribed time, that student will be subject to automatic suspension and may be dismissed from the College of Pharmacy.</p>
<h2>Academic Suspension</h2>
<p>Academic suspension from the College of Pharmacy occurs when a student:</p>
<ul>
	<li>has failed to make satisfactory progress during a period of academic probation;</li>
	<li>has academic deficiencies that preclude continuation in a normal program of study, but may be expected to be able to complete the requirements for the degree under a modified program of study with or without remedial courses;</li>
	<li>and/or has received a failing grade in any two professional required courses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suspensions are imposed for a specified period of time, not to exceed one year. A student on academic suspension will not be allowed to continue the normal course of study. The Academic Performance and Standards Committee will specify the length of time of the suspension, and remedial work required for reinstatement, and the program of study required upon reinstatement.</p>
<h2>Academic Dismissal</h2>
<p>Academic dismissal from the College of Pharmacy may be recommended to the Faculty by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee if a student:</p>
<ul>
	<li>fails to make satisfactory progress during a period of academic probation, or suspension, and has academic deficiencies that preclude continuation in the prescribed program of study, and may not reasonably be expected to complete the requirements for the degree.</li>
</ul>
<p>Except under very extenuating circumstances, academic dismissal will be recommended if a student:</p>
<ul>
	<li>was previously suspended from the College, and again fails to make satisfactory academic progress;</li>
	<li>is on academic suspension under a remedial course of study and again fails to make satisfactory academic progress;</li>
	<li>fails a single professional required course more than one time, or accumulates more than two failures in professional required courses;</li>
	<li>and/or accumulates a grade point deficiency that reasonably precludes the possibility of completing the degree requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are dismissed from the College by a majority vote of the Faculty. Students dismissed from the College may seek reentry by applying for readmission.</p>
<h2>Appeals</h2>
<p>At the end of each academic term, the Office of the Dean reviews the academic performance of all students enrolled in the College of Pharmacy, and evaluates each student’s qualifications to be retained and/or promoted in the professional program. The Office of the Dean notifies each student placed on academic probation; and furthermore, makes notification of current academic deficiencies to the student and the Academic Performance and Standards Committee. Each student is also notified of any decision by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee to require a modified course of study, to suspend progress, or to dismiss the student from the College.</p>
<p>Any student in the College of Pharmacy has the opportunity to appeal any decision made by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee. Written confirmation of a student’s intent to appeal must be received by the Office of the Dean within seven days of the student’s receipt of notification of the decision.</p>
<p>Students desiring to appeal must appear in person before a meeting of the Academic Performance and Standards Committee of the College of Pharmacy. A written petition must be presented containing the specific variance requested, a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance, and a proposed course of study and/or conditions for consideration should the variance be granted. The decision of the Academic Performance and Standards Committee may be further appealed to the Faculty of the College of Pharmacy. The decision of the Faculty of the College of Pharmacy is final.</p>
<h2>Drop/Add Withdrawal</h2>
<p>Fees may apply. Please contact Mandi Fishler in College of Pharmacy Student Services at 402-559-4333 or <a href="mailto:mandi.fishler@unmc.edu">mandi.fishler@unmc.edu</a>.</p>
<h2>Faculty Policy on Repeating Courses and Change of Grade Repeating Courses</h2>
<p>Students receiving a low or failing grade in a required or elective course in the College of Pharmacy may, of their own volition or upon direction of the Academic Performance and Standards Committee, repeat that course the next time it is offered in the schedule of course offerings. Required professional courses will not be offered on a conference basis. The student must register for any repeated course. The transcript will reflect such re-registration, and the second grade earned will be utilized in computing the GPAs.</p>
<h2>Change of Grade</h2>
<p>A course grade reported by the faculty may be changed. There are three situations that constitute legal reasons for changing a grade:</p>
<ol>
	<li>removal of an Incomplete (I) previously recorded;</li>
	<li>instructor error, including errors in grading and computation of a grade; and</li>
	<li>clerical error, including errors in recording one or more grades.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is not proper to offer a change of grade as a means of handling academic problems. Specifically, a student will not be allowed to repeat a portion of a course, and have that grade changed through filing a change of grade form. The above procedure for repeating courses will be followed for students receiving failing grades or needing to improve GPAs.</p>
<h2>Pharmacist Internship Requirement</h2>
<p>Registration with the State of Nebraska as a Pharmacist Intern is required before a student can participate in experiential training as part of the professional curriculum. Proof of valid Pharmacist Intern registration must be carried by the student during all experiential training. Students completing out of state pharmacy practice experiences may need to register as a Pharmacist Intern in the state of the experience. </p>
<h2>Policies on Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPE)</h2>
<p>Students in their first three years of school must complete 300 hours of IPPEs. </p>
<ul>
	<li>160 hours in community pharmacy practice</li>
	<li>120 hours in institutional/health system/hospital pharmacy</li>
	<li>20 hours drug information</li>
</ul>
<p>Grading policy for IPPEs is Pass/Fail.</p>
<h2>Policies on Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPE)</h2>
<p>Students may not progress to APPEs without successful completion of all coursework in the P1, P2, and P3 years, including didactic coursework and IPPE hours.</p>
<p>Fourth year pharmacy students must complete ten 4-week (total of 40 weeks; 1600 hours) of required and elective APPEs as outlined in the current course of study and as scheduled by the Office of Experiential Programs (OEP).  During the third year of the PharmD program, OEP will collaborate with the student on the selection of their APPE schedule. In scheduling APPEs, efforts will be made to accommodate special student needs; however, the final decision resides with the Assistant Dean of Experiential Education.  No scheduling exceptions will be made for housing considerations.  Students are advised to maintain their campus/Omaha housing arrangements until their APPEs schedules have been finalized.  Changes in APPE schedule may be considered for emergency situations, including changes in preceptor or site. </p>
<p>Grading policy for APPEs is Pass/Fail.  Students on APPEs may also receive Pass with Honors. </p>
<h2>Required APPEs</h2>
<p>Fourth year pharmacy students must complete 6-required APPEs as outlined in the course of study. Required clerkships must be completed at College affiliated sites that are precepted by faculty who hold a full-time or adjunct appointment in the College of Pharmacy.</p>
<h2>Elective APPEs</h2>
<p>Students are allowed to choose four elective APPEs. The OEP has a list of approved elective APPEs.  Elective APPEs must be completed at College affiliated sites that are precepted by faculty who hold a full-time or adjunct appointment in the College of Pharmacy. The OEP will work with students who desire an APPE that is not currently an affiliated site.</p>
<h2>Rural APPE Requirement</h2>
<p>All fourth year pharmacy students are expected to take at least one APPE in rural Nebraska.  The following cities and towns are not considered “rural areas” and APPEs in these areas do not fulfill the rural requirement for RHOP students:  Omaha, Ralston, Boys Town, Elkhorn, Lincoln, Bellevue, Papillion, La Vista, Chalco, and Offutt Air Force Base. Rural rotations must be completed within the state of Nebraska. Contact OEP with questions on qualifying sites</p>
<p>Students claiming that this policy creates an insurmountable personal hardship may appeal their situation to the Dean or his/her designee. The decision of the Dean is final.</p>
<h2>APPE Requirements for Rural Early Assurance Program Students</h2>
<p>Students admitted to the College of Pharmacy through the rural early assurance programs, i.e., Rural Health Opportunities Program (RHOP) and Rural Pharmacy Practice Educational Initiative (RPPEI), are required to complete a minimum of four clerkships in rural settings.  </p>
<p>The following cities and towns are not considered “rural areas” and APPEs in these areas do not fulfill the rural requirement for RHOP students:  Omaha, Ralston, Boys Town, Elkhorn, Lincoln, Bellevue, Papillion, La Vista, Chalco, and Offutt Air Force Base. Rural rotations must be completed within the state of Nebraska. Contact OEP with questions on qualifying sites.</p></div><!--end #textcontainer -->
