<h4><a id="prompts"></a>Prompt Suggestions</h4>
<p>The questions that you ask Gemini, including any input information or code you want Gemini to analyze or complete, are called <em>prompts</em>. The answers or code completions that you receive from Gemini are called <em>responses</em>. When you ask Gemini, you should <strong>include as much context and specific detail as possible</strong>. Because AI-generated responses are based on a vast range of possibilities, it is important for you to be precise. For the best results, your prompts should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> exceed 4,000 characters.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Below are six ways to provide helpful context and detail in your prompts.<br/>For more information, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/discover/write-prompts" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">review the full Gemini support article</span></a>.</h5></content></p></div>

<h5 style="text-align: center;">Write your prompt like you are speaking with a person</h5>
<p>Do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> enter only keywords as you might when searching for a document online, but include the kind of detail you would include when explaining a problem to someone. For example, instead of entering the terms "workload GKE," ask a complete question: "What kinds of workloads does GKE support?"</p></card-content></div>

<h5 style="text-align: center;">Describe why you are trying to accomplish a task</h5>
<p>Details about what you are trying to accomplish can help Gemini provide a more useful answer. For example, telling Gemini that you want to "set up a simple, secure CMS site for hosting a blog" has more helpful details than only asking "how to deploy a website." Because there are often multiple correct ways to accomplish a technical goal, providing Gemini sufficient context can help ensure a good response.</p></card-content></div>

<h5 style="text-align: center;">Ask to include all the parameters in a command</h5>
<p>For example, when you ask Gemini to generate code functions, you are likely to produce a more useful and detailed response by telling it to "make sure all methods use their required arguments."</p></card-content></div>

<h5 style="text-align: center;">Include your level of expertise</h5>
<p>It is especially helpful to match your prompt request with your expertise level when you ask for a suggestion. Asking Gemini to explain a concept or code as if you are an expert programmer&#8212;or a novice programmer&#8212;can give you different, and more appropriate, results.</p></card-content></div>

<h5 style="text-align: center;">Include details about products and technologies</h5>
<p>If you are looking for answers about a specific product, technology, or technical capability, include that in your prompt. Similarly, specifying a programming language can help you get more relevant responses. If you are unsure about what technologies or products to consider, ask Gemini to compare different options for you.</p></card-content></div>
