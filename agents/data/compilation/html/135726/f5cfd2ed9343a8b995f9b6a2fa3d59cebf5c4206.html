Responsible AI means designing Copilot not just as a tool, but as part of a broader system that includes the people who use it, those affected by its outputs, and the environment in which it operates.</p>
<p>In Microsoft 365 Copilot for Service, this includes features like asking questions, summarizing cases and conversations, writing emails, and generating resolution notes&#8212;all based on data your organization provides. These tools are built with Microsoft's principles of fairness, reliability, privacy, and transparency in mind.</p>
