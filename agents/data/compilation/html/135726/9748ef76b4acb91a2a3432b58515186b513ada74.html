The statistically derived model uses a proprietary algorithm and 17 variables to stratify your adult asthma population into risk buckets. Identifying and stratifying these patients makes it possible for clinicians to deliver proactive, targeted interventions that are designed to prevent dangerous flare-ups. The goal of the model is to better outcomes for patients and better utilization of your resources, such as your ED.</td>

One inpatient model scores the general pediatric population and one model scores pediatric patients with high-risk conditions who are predisposed to developing sepsis. These models uses data points such as temperature, BP, behavioral assessments, length of stay, and diagnoses to help clinicians identify septic pediatric patients (under 20 years old) before they worsen. The inpatient model that scores patients with high-risk conditions is not available to organizations in the EU or the UK due to locale-based differences in the regulation of decision support.</td>

<td>The model can be used a number of ways in clinician-facing workflows, but two primary workflows are recommended for this model. The first is showing the score in Storyboard or a similarly visible location in the chart so clinicians can reference a patient&#8217;s score before ordering. This workflow is ideal for settings where opioids might be prescribed on a regular basis, such as in the emergency department, in a pain clinic, or during inpatient discharge planning. The second primary workflow is in a BestPractice Advisory (BPA) related to opioid ordering so users placing an opioid order are alerted when a patient has high risk. This workflow is ideal for outpatient and emergency department ordering. The model could also be used as additional filtering for your organization&#8217;s existing opioid-related BPAs.</td>

The model uses dozens of data points such as financial class, vitals, assessments, medications, and lab results to help your organization identify patients who are most at risk of falling. This information enables nurses to focus interventions on the patients who are most likely to fall without them. The model can improve on the performance of manual fall risk assessments, while requiring minimal additional input from clinicians or operational staff. After it is implemented, the model can run continuously, saving up to 3 minutes per patient per day.</td>
