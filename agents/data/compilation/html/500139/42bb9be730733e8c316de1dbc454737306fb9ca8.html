evidence came from state and district pilots - Indiana's 2023–24\nAI‑Powered Platform Pilot Grant (a one‑year, $2 million federal relief–funded\nrollout that left 53% of participating teachers reporting positive experiences)\nand Indianapolis Public Schools' 20‑staff pilot that informed a districtwide AI\npolicy (Phase 2 expands staff use of Google Gemini) - so what: districts can run\na semester‑long pilot and expect concrete workload relief rather than abstract\npromise.\n\nMethodology steps included vetting vendor documentation, requiring professional\nlearning plans, prioritizing tools that integrate with cloud infrastructure, and\ndefining KPIs (teacher workload, student equity, data minimization).\n\nThese criteria align with state rollout guidance and SchoolAI's recommended\nplaybook for focused pilots and steering committees, and they shaped the Top‑10\nprompts to be classroom‑ready, privacy‑conscious, and evaluable within one\nacademic term.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERION                       EVIDENCE / SOURCE\nShort pilot, measurable teacher impact    \nPolicy & professional learning required   \nState playbook for scaling responsibly    \n\n\n\n\n> “We want to make sure that staff feel well equipped to determine what the\n> boundaries are for use of AI in a classroom.” - Ashley Cowger, Chief Systems\n> Officer, Indianapolis Public Schools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndianapolis Public Schools - Administrative Automation with Google Gemini\n\n(Up)\n\nIndianapolis Public Schools can reclaim hours of staff time by using Google's\nGemini tools to automate routine administrative work: Gemini in Classroom helps\ndraft lesson plans, generate quizzes that export directly to Google Forms, and\ncreate standard‑aligned rubrics and student feedback at scale ().\n\nBuilt‑in admin controls and enterprise‑grade protections let district IT enable\nor restrict access, audit usage with Vault, and keep Workspace data from being\nused to train external models - important for FERPA and district policy\ncompliance ().\n\nPairing Gemini with a short, targeted PD sequence and Chromebook rollouts can\nmove IPS from pilot to operational gains quickly; practical first steps include\nautomating newsletters, permission‑slip templates, meeting notes, and tagging\nassignments to CASE standards for faster reporting ().\n\n\n\n\n> “the rubric generation tool… turning the repetitive task of making a rubric\n> into a quick and easy one, bringing your rubric right into Classroom in a\n> matter of seconds.” - Chris Webb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIvy Tech Community College - Early‑Alert Predictive Analytics for Retention\n\n(Up)\n\nIvy Tech pairs AI-driven early‑alert predictive analytics that monitor early\ncourse performance and flag at‑risk students with human outreach and habit‑based\nsupports, turning data into timely interventions that keep students enrolled\nacross Indiana: the analytics surface who needs contact, campus leads reach out\nby text, email, and in person, and pilots tying those alerts to Ivy Achieves' 10\nhigh‑impact habits produced clear downstream gains - students with six habits\nwere 94% registered for spring and the pilot (1,840 students on 10 campuses)\ndemonstrated how timely nudges convert flags into persistence (, ).\n\nFor Indianapolis institutions evaluating retention tech, the lesson is\npractical: pair a narrow, auditable early‑alert model with campus leads and\nmeasurable onboarding habits to turn alerts into higher registration and clearer\npathways to degree completion.\n\n\nMETRIC                              VALUE\nSystem‑wide students served         157,000 (19 campuses)\nPilot participants                  1,840 students on 10 campuses\nFall‑to‑fall retention (system)     47%\nRegistration if 6 habits complete   94% registered for spring\n\n\n\n\n> “Early momentum metrics and holistic onboarding can help students feel\n> supported and belong in college.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurdue University - AI Professional Learning and Microcredentials\n\n(Up)\n\nPurdue University's stackable AI microcredentials give Indiana educators and\ndistrict staff a practical, low‑lift route to certify classroom‑ready AI skills:\neach mini‑credential averages about 15 hours to complete, covers applied topics\nfrom prompt engineering and NLP to AI policy and data storytelling, and awards a\ncertificate for every course finished - so teachers can upskill between grading\ncycles or a short summer PD window without long absences ().\n\nThe catalog lists 13 discrete courses and a transparent per‑course cost ($500),\nletting districts assemble targeted professional learning paths that are\nauditable and stackable for career advancement ().\n\nFor Indianapolis institutions planning FERPA‑aware pilots and teacher\ntime‑savings, these faculty‑taught, short courses provide concrete building\nblocks - prompt practice, ethics, and governance - that map directly to the\noperational needs shown in recent local pilots ().\n\n\nPROGRAM DETAIL             VALUE\nAverage time to complete   15 hours\nNumber of courses          13\nIndividual course cost     $500\n\n\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology - \"Jill Watson\" Virtual Teaching Assistant\n\n(Up)\n\nGeorgia Tech's Jill Watson - now rebuilt on ChatGPT - demonstrates a pragmatic\nmodel Indianapolis educators can study when weighing virtual teaching\nassistants: the agent grounds answers in verified courseware (syllabi,\ntranscripts, slides), keeps conversational history in agent memory, and uses a\nquestion‑answering pipeline with moderation and coreference resolution so\nresponses remain consistent and auditable; empirically this approach not only\noutperformed OpenAI's Assistant in pass rates but also correlated with modest\ngrade gains (A's ~66% with Jill vs ~62% without) and fewer low grades,\nsuggesting a concrete “so what”: offloading routine Q&A can measurably free\ninstructor time while improving teaching and social presence in large online\nclasses.\n\nFor technical and policy teams, the full methods, architecture, and experimental\nresults are documented in the project report (Jill Watson project report at\nAI‑ALOE: ) and discussed in practitioner Q&As on VTA design (Georgia Tech Q&A on\nvirtual teaching assistants and student success: ), offering a replicable\nstarting point for Indianapolis pilots that must balance pedagogy, FERPA‑aware\ndata practices, and human oversight.\n\n\nMETRIC                                 VALUE\nAnswer accuracy (pre‑deployment)       ~75%–97%\nA grades (with Jill vs without)        ~66% vs ~62%\nJW‑GPT pass rate vs OpenAI‑Assistant   78.7% vs 30.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> “The Jill Watson upgrade is a leap forward.

however, the studies also documented harmful edge cases and\nstressed the need for human oversight and clear escalation pathways (, ).\n\nFor Indianapolis schools and campus counseling centers, the practical takeaway\nis that a scoped chatbot can provide 24/7 motivational triage and reduce demand\non clinicians - if deployed with auditable escalation protocols, clinician\nhandoffs, and FERPA‑aligned data handling as outlined in local pilot checklists\n().\n\n\nMETRIC                                        VALUE\nParticipants                                  349\nShort‑term confidence gain                    +1.0 to +1.3 (11‑point scale)\nReflection appropriateness (GPT‑4 vs GPT‑2)   ~98% vs ~70%\n\n\n\n\n> “If you could have a good conversation anytime you needed it to help mitigate\n> feelings of anxiety and depression, then that would be a net benefit to\n> humanity and society.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart Sparrow - Personalized Adaptive Learning Platforms\n\n(Up)\n\nSmart Sparrow's adaptive platform gives Indiana instructors granular control to\nbuild active, branched lessons and simulations that meet local course standards\nwhile scaling costly hands‑on experiences - useful for Indianapolis colleges\nthat face lab space and equipment limits.\n\nEducators author “If THIS, then THAT” adaptivity (just‑in‑time hints,\ndifferentiated pathways, and real‑time feedback), deploy through an LMS, and see\nlive analytics to pinpoint misconceptions and intervene before failure;\ndeployments show real gains in engagement and outcomes and practical savings\nsuch as replacing slow manual grading workflows with time‑limited, automatically\nscored adaptive exams.\n\nFor example, Smart Sparrow supports virtual labs, simulations, and adaptive\ntutorials that replicate expensive experiments at lower cost and enable\ninstructors to reclaim instructor hours for high‑impact teaching - so what: a\nsingle adaptive exam workflow has been credited with saving roughly 30 hours of\ninstructor grading per exam while surfacing data to guide interventions.\n\nLearn more in Smart Sparrow's adaptive learning overview, explore institution\ndemos, or review adaptive‑tutorial exam use cases.\n\n\nMETRIC / FEATURE                  VALUE / EXAMPLE\nInstructor control & adaptivity   Designed adaptivity (authoring “If THIS, then THAT” rules)\nReported impact                   Engagement +57%, outcomes +28% (Doherty et al., 2018)\nTime savings example              ~30 hours saved per exam (UNSW adaptive tutorials\n                                  deployment)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> “The adaptive lessons developed using Smart Sparrow improved the pre-class\n> learning experience of my students – both, cognitively and affectively.” - Dr.\n> Autar Kaw\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Alicante - Accessibility with \"Help Me See\" App\n\n(Up)\n\nUniversity of Alicante's accessibility suite - led by the AI‑powered “Help Me\nSee” mobile app - demonstrates practical assistive AI Indianapolis campuses can\nmodel: Help Me See uses computer vision and machine‑learning to assist blind and\nlow‑vision students with navigation and obstacle alerts, building on research\nthat used a phone's 3D camera to warn users of obstacles roughly two meters away\n(); the UA platform also runs Navilens for indoor wayfinding and recently added\nan AI subtitling and transcription tool that generates time‑synced captions with\nprocessing kept on university servers to strengthen multimedia privacy and\ncontrol (, ).\n\nSo what: Indianapolis institutions can replicate this stack to cut accommodation\nwait times, increase campus independence for students with visual or hearing\nimpairments, and maintain local data control as part of FERPA‑aware deployments.\n\n\nTOOL                         CAPABILITY                                            PRIVACY/NOTE\nHelp Me See                  Computer‑vision navigation & obstacle alerts          Mobile on‑device sensing (3D camera research)\nNavilens                     Long‑range, high‑density indoor wayfinding markers    Pilot deployed on UA campus maps\nSubtitling & Transcription   AI‑generated, time‑synced captions for videos/audio   Processing on UA servers for privacy\n\n\n\nJuilliard School - \"Music Mentor\" Performance Feedback Tools\n\n(Up)\n\nJuilliard's conservatory structure - centered on intensive applied training\n(students receive 15 one‑hour studio lessons per semester) and a Pre‑College\npractice‑buddy program where prep percussionists run half‑hour weekly Zoom\nsessions with elementary students - offers a concrete model Indianapolis music\nprograms can mirror when introducing an AI “Music Mentor” that provides instant,\npractice‑level feedback between human touchpoints; so what: pairing quick,\nautomated feedback on rhythm, dynamics, and posture with Juilliard‑style\nfrequent coaching can accelerate deliberate practice cycles and free instructors\nto focus on ensemble work and higher‑order musicianship (see Juilliard's and the\n).\n\nLocal pilots should follow Juilliard's rules for unedited student recordings,\nteacher‑assigned repertoire, and clear audition/assessment timelines so\nautomated feedback remains auditable, FERPA‑aware, and integrated with human\noversight rather than replacing it.\n\n\nFEATURE                       JUILLIARD EXAMPLE\nStudio lessons per semester   \nPrep Division mentoring       \n\n\n\n\n> “The main learning tool of El Sistema is the music ensemble, so having these\n> kids learn to work together is perfect in terms of our theme of connections.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSanta Monica College - AI‑Driven Career and Guidance Systems\n\n(Up)\n\nSanta Monica College models a pragmatic pathway Indianapolis institutions can\nmirror for AI‑driven career and guidance systems: SMC's online EDUC 50 “AI for\nEducators” course - built from Lynn Dickinson's How to Use ChatGPT and which\nfilled its initial 45‑student section within hours and expanded to two sections\n- prepares faculty to teach AI literacy and integrate ethical prompt practices\ninto career advising, while SMC's hands‑on offerings (like the ) and its\ninteraction‑design pipeline create stackable, job‑ready skills; pairing that\nsupply of trained instructors and technical coursework with a campus\ndegree‑planning platform such as (used by large universities including Indiana\nUniversity) lets advisors automate audits, show clear pathways to AI roles, and\nsurface timely alerts so more students can convert interest into employment - so\nwhat: the combined system turns one‑off AI PD into scalable career routing that\nshortens time‑to‑placement while keeping human advisors in the loop.\n\n\nOFFERING                       KEY FACT\nEDUC 50 - AI for Educators     Initial section capacity 45;

the policy also builds human oversight into every\nstage with an AI advisory board, monthly professional development for pilot\nparticipants, and an always‑available online PD repository so educators learn\nlimits as well as capabilities (see the IPS policy summary on ).\n\nFor districts mapping next steps, offers a step‑by‑step framework to align\npilots with instructional priorities, data minimization, and auditability - so\nwhat: these controls let Indianapolis convert quick admin time‑savings into\nsustained, FERPA‑compliant practices without exposing sensitive student records.\n\n\nPOLICY ELEMENT      DETAIL\nAcceptable uses     Teacher‑supervised quiz/material generation, lesson support,\n                    communications\nTool restrictions   Only district‑approved AI products;

It can\n> be a slippery slope, which is why we have put a lot of effort into developing\n> the professional learning roadmap for AI for the pilot users for next school\n> year.” - Ashley Cowger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion - Getting Started with AI in Indianapolis Education\n\n(Up)\n\nGetting started in Indianapolis means pairing small, auditable pilots with clear\nprivacy controls and focused professional learning: follow IPS' playbook of a\n20‑staff pilot and a Phase‑2 rollout using Google Gemini (budgeted at about $122\nper person) while enforcing district‑approved tools and data minimization in\ncontracts (see the IPS AI policy on ); require vendor vetting and a FERPA/COPPA\nchecklist before any classroom data is shared (use SchoolAI's compliance primer\nat ), and invest in short, practical upskilling - Nucamp's AI Essentials for\nWork is a 15‑week, hands‑on path to prompt writing and tool evaluation\n(early‑bird $3,582; registration and syllabus at ) - so what: a low‑cost,\n20‑person pilot plus vendor controls and targeted PD can convert the district's\nearly time‑savings into repeatable, FERPA‑compliant practice without large\nsystemwide disruption.\n\n\nSTARTER STEP        PRACTICAL DETAIL                                              SOURCE\nRun a small pilot   ~20 staff; Phase‑2 Gemini pilot (~$122/user)                  \nLock vendor terms   Require no student‑data training, retention limits, and       \n                    audit logs\nTrain staff         Targeted PD: 15‑week bootcamp for prompts & tool evaluation   \n                    (early‑bird $3,582)\n\n\n\n\n> “We do not at any point encourage someone going in blindly to using AI. It can\n> be a slippery slope, which is why we have put a lot of effort into developing\n> the professional learning roadmap for AI for the pilot users for next school\n> year.” - Ashley Cowger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n(Up)\n\n\nWhat are the top AI use cases and prompts recommended for Indianapolis\neducation?\n\nRecommended use cases include administrative automation (e.g., lesson plans,\nrubrics, newsletters with Google Gemini), early‑alert predictive analytics for\nretention, virtual teaching assistants (Jill Watson style), mental‑health\nchatbots with escalation, personalized adaptive learning, accessibility tools\n(navigation and captions), AI performance feedback for music practice, and\nAI‑driven career/advising systems. Prompts focus on task templates (quiz\ngeneration, rubric creation), targeted student outreach messages,\nmodel‑grounding instructions (reference course materials), ethical escalation\nflows, and accessibility/transcription prompts that keep processing on\ninstitution servers.\n\n\n\nHow were the top 10 use cases and prompts selected for Indiana districts?\n\nSelection prioritized three practical criteria: measurable teacher time savings\nin short pilots, clear FERPA‑aligned data practices, and feasible scaling\nwithout expensive replatforming. Evidence sources included IPS's 20‑staff pilot,\nIndiana's 2023–24 AI‑Powered Platform Pilot Grant results, vendor documentation,\nstate guidance, and professional learning plans. KPIs defined included teacher\nworkload, student equity, and data minimization, and methodology required vendor\nvetting and integration with cloud infrastructure.\n\n\n\nWhat privacy, governance, and training safeguards should Indianapolis schools\nadopt when deploying AI?\n\nAdopt district‑approved tool lists, responsible‑use agreements for staff,\nFERPA/COPPA compliance checks, data minimization rules (prohibit uploading full\nIEPs), vendor contract clauses preventing student data from training external\nmodels, audit logging, an AI advisory board, and monthly PD for pilot\nparticipants. Pair these with targeted professional learning (e.g., 15‑week AI\nEssentials for Work) and a small pilot model (~20 staff) before wider rollout.\n\n\n\nWhat measurable benefits did local pilots and studies show for these AI use\ncases?\n\nReported benefits include concrete teacher time savings (examples: automated\nrubrics and quizzes, ~30 hours saved per exam in adaptive deployments), positive\npilot experiences (Indiana grant: 53% of participating teachers reported\npositive experiences), improved retention when early‑alert models were paired\nwith habit tracking (Ivy Tech: students with six habits were 94% registered for\nspring), and small but measurable gains in student outcomes with virtual\nassistants and adaptive tools (e.g., Jill Watson correlated with modest grade\ngains and higher pass rates).\n\n\n\nHow should an Indianapolis district get started with AI pilots and scale\nresponsibly?\n\nStart with a focused, semester‑long pilot of ~20 staff using district‑approved\ntools (IPS used Google Gemini in Phase 2), set clear KPIs (teacher workload,\nequity, auditability), require vendor vetting and FERPA/COPPA checklists, lock\ncontract terms that prevent student‑data training and require retention limits\nand audit logs, and pair deployments with short, stackable professional learning\n(e.g., 15‑hour microcredentials or a 15‑week bootcamp) so gains are transferable\nand governed.\n\nYou may be interested in the following topics as well:\n\n * See why is critical to preserve meaningful student evaluation in the AI era.\n\n * Learn why robust are essential to manage bias, equity, and legal risk."}</script><!----><!----><title>Top 10 AI Prompts and Use Cases and in the Education Industry in Indianapolis</title>

districtwide AI rules and a Phase‑2 Google Gemini rollout (~$122/user). Evidence: Indiana's $2M pilot (53% teacher approval), Ivy Tech retention pilot (1,840 students), and 15‑week PD ($3,582 early bird).</p></div>
<p>Indiana education is shifting from pilots to policy as districts aim to capture AI's time‑saving benefits while protecting students: Indianapolis Public Schools recently approved a districtwide AI policy after a 20‑staff pilot where district‑approved tools helped teachers and a principal save time on administrative work and even transform a secondary master schedule; the district plans a wider Phase 2 rollout using Google Gemini (see the IPS policy summary at Chalkbeat).</p><p> State guidance for K–12 underscores AI literacy, FERPA/COPPA compliance, and human oversight as core safeguards - practical guardrails that let schools deploy tutors, lesson‑differentiation, and automated reporting without sacrificing privacy (see Indiana K–12 AI guidance).</p><p> For educators and administrators preparing to implement these changes, structured professional learning such as the AI Essentials for Work bootcamp supports prompt writing, tool evaluation, and workplace-ready AI skills to turn pilot gains into sustained practice.

</p><p></p><blockquote>“The Jill Watson upgrade is a leap forward. With persistent prompting I managed to coax it from explicit knowledge to tacit knowledge. That's a different league right there, moving beyond merely gossip (saying what it has been told) to giving a thought‑through answer after analysis. I didn't take it through a comprehensive battery of tests to probe the limits of its capability, but it's definitely promising. Kudos to the team.”</blockquote><p></p>

class="TOCUP">(Up)</span></div><p>University of Toronto researchers tested an MI‑style chatbot that used large language models to deliver brief therapeutic conversations and produced small but measurable changes - 349 participants showed a 1.0–1.3 point rise on an 11‑point quit‑confidence scale one week after a session - and the team reported major quality gains using newer models (GPT‑4 reflections ~98% appropriate vs ~70% with GPT‑2); however, the studies also documented harmful edge cases and stressed the need for human oversight and clear escalation pathways (<a href="https://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/u-of-t-researchers-are-developing-a-chatbot-to-help-people-stop-smoking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Toronto MI chatbot coverage</a>, <a href="https://www.jmir.org/2023/1/e48659/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JMIR study on ChatGPT for clinical workflows</a>).</p><p> For Indianapolis schools and campus counseling centers, the practical takeaway is that a scoped chatbot can provide 24/7 motivational triage and reduce demand on clinicians - if deployed with auditable escalation protocols, clinician handoffs, and FERPA‑aligned data handling as outlined in local pilot checklists (<a

</p><div id="h2break" class="h2Div"><h2 id="Section12">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><span class="TOCUP">(Up)</span></div><div class="faq"><h3>What are the top AI use cases and prompts recommended for Indianapolis education?</h3><p>Recommended use cases include administrative automation (e.g., lesson plans, rubrics, newsletters with Google Gemini), early‑alert predictive analytics for retention, virtual teaching assistants (Jill Watson style), mental‑health chatbots with escalation, personalized adaptive learning, accessibility tools (navigation and captions), AI performance feedback for music practice, and AI‑driven career/advising systems. Prompts focus on task templates (quiz generation, rubric creation), targeted student outreach messages, model‑grounding instructions (reference course materials), ethical escalation flows, and accessibility/transcription prompts that keep processing on institution servers.</p></div>
<div class="faq"><h3>How were the top 10 use cases and prompts selected for Indiana districts?</h3><p>Selection prioritized three practical criteria: measurable teacher time savings in short pilots, clear FERPA‑aligned data practices, and feasible scaling without expensive replatforming. Evidence sources included IPS's 20‑staff pilot, Indiana's 2023–24 AI‑Powered Platform Pilot Grant results, vendor documentation, state guidance, and professional learning plans. KPIs defined included teacher workload, student equity, and data minimization, and methodology required vendor vetting and integration with cloud infrastructure.</p></div>
<div class="faq"><h3>What privacy, governance, and training safeguards should Indianapolis schools adopt when deploying AI?</h3><p>Adopt district‑approved tool lists, responsible‑use agreements for staff, FERPA/COPPA compliance checks, data minimization rules (prohibit uploading full IEPs), vendor contract clauses preventing student data from training external models, audit logging, an AI advisory board, and monthly PD for pilot participants. Pair these with targeted professional learning (e.g., 15‑week AI Essentials for Work) and a small pilot model (~20 staff) before wider rollout.</p></div>
<div class="faq"><h3>What measurable benefits did local pilots and studies show for these AI use cases?</h3><p>Reported benefits include concrete teacher time savings (examples: automated rubrics and quizzes, ~30 hours saved per exam in adaptive deployments), positive pilot experiences (Indiana grant: 53% of participating teachers reported positive experiences), improved retention when early‑alert models were paired with habit tracking (Ivy Tech: students with six habits were 94% registered for spring), and small but measurable gains in student outcomes with virtual assistants and adaptive tools (e.g., Jill Watson correlated with modest grade gains and higher pass rates).</p></div>
<div class="faq"><h3>How should an Indianapolis district get started with AI pilots and scale responsibly?</h3><p>Start with a focused, semester‑long pilot of ~20 staff using district‑approved tools (IPS used Google Gemini in Phase 2), set clear KPIs (teacher workload, equity, auditability), require vendor vetting and FERPA/COPPA checklists, lock contract terms that prevent student‑data training and require retention limits and audit logs, and pair deployments with short, stackable professional learning (e.g., 15‑hour microcredentials or a 15‑week bootcamp) so gains are transferable and governed.</p></div><div class="peerArticles"><h4><ion-icon name="bulb"></ion-icon>You may be interested in the following topics as well:</h4><ul><li><p>See why <a href="/blog/coding-bootcamp-indianapolis-in-education-top-5-jobs-in-education-that-are-most-at-risk-from-ai-in-indianapolis--and-how-to-adapt">redesigning assessments for AI</a> is critical to preserve meaningful student evaluation in the AI era.</p></li><li><p>Learn why robust <a href="/blog/coding-bootcamp-indianapolis-in-education-how-ai-is-helping-education-companies-in-indianapolis-cut-costs-and-improve-efficiency">responsible-use agreements and governance</a> are essential to manage bias, equity, and legal risk.</p></li></ul></div><!----></div> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]--><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--> <!--[--><!--[--><!----><div class="border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow rounded-sm mx-3 mb-8 md:mx-0 md:mb-0 dark:bg-slate-700"><!--[--><!----><div class="flex flex-col space-y-1.5 p-6 pb-4"><!--[--><div class="flex flex-grow-0 justify-between"><div class="flex flex-row"><!----><!----><!--$s25--><!--[!--><div class="relative flex h-10 w-10 shrink-0 overflow-hidden rounded-full" id="bits-s25" data-avatar-root="" data-status="loading"><!--[--><!----><!----><!--$s26--><!--[!--><img alt="Ludo Fourrage Blog Author for Nucamp" class="aspect-square h-full w-full" id="bits-s26" style="display: none;" data-status="loading" data-avatar-image="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/nucamp-production.appspot.com/images/ludo.webp" onload="this.__e=event" onerror="this.__e=event"/><!--]--><!----><!----> <!----><!----><!--$s27--><!--[!--><span class="flex h-full w-full items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-muted" data-status="loading" data-avatar-fallback=""><!--[--><!---->N<!----><!--]--><!----></span><!--]--><!----><!----><!----><!--]--><!----></div><!--]--><!----><!----> <div class="flex flex-col ml-4"><!----><!----><h3 class="font-semibold leading-none tracking-tight"><!--[--><a href="https://www.nucamp.co/blogs/authors/ludo-fourrage?page=1" class="text-nucamp-primary underline underline-offset-2 decoration-dotted hover:text-nucamp-secondary">Ludo Fourrage</a><!----><!--]--><!----></h3><!----><!----> <!----><p class="text-sm text-muted-foreground"><!--[--><!---->Founder and CEO<!----><!--]--></p><!----></div></div> <div><!--[--><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludovicfourrage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Ludo Fourrage on LinkedIn"><ion-icon name="logo-linkedin"></ion-icon></a><!--]--> <!--[--><a href="https://twitter.com/ludovicfourrage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Ludo Fourrage on Twitter"><ion-icon name="logo-twitter"></ion-icon></a><!--]--></div></div><!----><!--]--></div><!----> <!----><div class="p-6 pt-0"><!--[--><p class="text-sm border-t-2 pt-4">Ludovic (Ludo) Fourrage is an education industry veteran, named in 2017 as a Learning Technology Leader by Training Magazine.

evidence came from state and district pilots - Indiana's 2023–24\nAI‑Powered Platform Pilot Grant (a one‑year, $2 million federal relief–funded\nrollout that left 53% of participating teachers reporting positive experiences)\nand Indianapolis Public Schools' 20‑staff pilot that informed a districtwide AI\npolicy (Phase 2 expands staff use of Google Gemini) - so what: districts can run\na semester‑long pilot and expect concrete workload relief rather than abstract\npromise.\n\nMethodology steps included vetting vendor documentation, requiring professional\nlearning plans, prioritizing tools that integrate with cloud infrastructure, and\ndefining KPIs (teacher workload, student equity, data minimization).\n\nThese criteria align with state rollout guidance and SchoolAI's recommended\nplaybook for focused pilots and steering committees, and they shaped the Top‑10\nprompts to be classroom‑ready, privacy‑conscious, and evaluable within one\nacademic term.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERION                       EVIDENCE / SOURCE\nShort pilot, measurable teacher impact    \nPolicy & professional learning required   \nState playbook for scaling responsibly    \n\n\n\n\n> “We want to make sure that staff feel well equipped to determine what the\n> boundaries are for use of AI in a classroom.” - Ashley Cowger, Chief Systems\n> Officer, Indianapolis Public Schools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndianapolis Public Schools - Administrative Automation with Google Gemini\n\n(Up)\n\nIndianapolis Public Schools can reclaim hours of staff time by using Google's\nGemini tools to automate routine administrative work: Gemini in Classroom helps\ndraft lesson plans, generate quizzes that export directly to Google Forms, and\ncreate standard‑aligned rubrics and student feedback at scale ().\n\nBuilt‑in admin controls and enterprise‑grade protections let district IT enable\nor restrict access, audit usage with Vault, and keep Workspace data from being\nused to train external models - important for FERPA and district policy\ncompliance ().\n\nPairing Gemini with a short, targeted PD sequence and Chromebook rollouts can\nmove IPS from pilot to operational gains quickly; practical first steps include\nautomating newsletters, permission‑slip templates, meeting notes, and tagging\nassignments to CASE standards for faster reporting ().\n\n\n\n\n> “the rubric generation tool… turning the repetitive task of making a rubric\n> into a quick and easy one, bringing your rubric right into Classroom in a\n> matter of seconds.” - Chris Webb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIvy Tech Community College - Early‑Alert Predictive Analytics for Retention\n\n(Up)\n\nIvy Tech pairs AI-driven early‑alert predictive analytics that monitor early\ncourse performance and flag at‑risk students with human outreach and habit‑based\nsupports, turning data into timely interventions that keep students enrolled\nacross Indiana: the analytics surface who needs contact, campus leads reach out\nby text, email, and in person, and pilots tying those alerts to Ivy Achieves' 10\nhigh‑impact habits produced clear downstream gains - students with six habits\nwere 94% registered for spring and the pilot (1,840 students on 10 campuses)\ndemonstrated how timely nudges convert flags into persistence (, ).\n\nFor Indianapolis institutions evaluating retention tech, the lesson is\npractical: pair a narrow, auditable early‑alert model with campus leads and\nmeasurable onboarding habits to turn alerts into higher registration and clearer\npathways to degree completion.\n\n\nMETRIC                              VALUE\nSystem‑wide students served         157,000 (19 campuses)\nPilot participants                  1,840 students on 10 campuses\nFall‑to‑fall retention (system)     47%\nRegistration if 6 habits complete   94% registered for spring\n\n\n\n\n> “Early momentum metrics and holistic onboarding can help students feel\n> supported and belong in college.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurdue University - AI Professional Learning and Microcredentials\n\n(Up)\n\nPurdue University's stackable AI microcredentials give Indiana educators and\ndistrict staff a practical, low‑lift route to certify classroom‑ready AI skills:\neach mini‑credential averages about 15 hours to complete, covers applied topics\nfrom prompt engineering and NLP to AI policy and data storytelling, and awards a\ncertificate for every course finished - so teachers can upskill between grading\ncycles or a short summer PD window without long absences ().\n\nThe catalog lists 13 discrete courses and a transparent per‑course cost ($500),\nletting districts assemble targeted professional learning paths that are\nauditable and stackable for career advancement ().\n\nFor Indianapolis institutions planning FERPA‑aware pilots and teacher\ntime‑savings, these faculty‑taught, short courses provide concrete building\nblocks - prompt practice, ethics, and governance - that map directly to the\noperational needs shown in recent local pilots ().\n\n\nPROGRAM DETAIL             VALUE\nAverage time to complete   15 hours\nNumber of courses          13\nIndividual course cost     $500\n\n\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology - \"Jill Watson\" Virtual Teaching Assistant\n\n(Up)\n\nGeorgia Tech's Jill Watson - now rebuilt on ChatGPT - demonstrates a pragmatic\nmodel Indianapolis educators can study when weighing virtual teaching\nassistants: the agent grounds answers in verified courseware (syllabi,\ntranscripts, slides), keeps conversational history in agent memory, and uses a\nquestion‑answering pipeline with moderation and coreference resolution so\nresponses remain consistent and auditable; empirically this approach not only\noutperformed OpenAI's Assistant in pass rates but also correlated with modest\ngrade gains (A's ~66% with Jill vs ~62% without) and fewer low grades,\nsuggesting a concrete “so what”: offloading routine Q&A can measurably free\ninstructor time while improving teaching and social presence in large online\nclasses.\n\nFor technical and policy teams, the full methods, architecture, and experimental\nresults are documented in the project report (Jill Watson project report at\nAI‑ALOE: ) and discussed in practitioner Q&As on VTA design (Georgia Tech Q&A on\nvirtual teaching assistants and student success: ), offering a replicable\nstarting point for Indianapolis pilots that must balance pedagogy, FERPA‑aware\ndata practices, and human oversight.\n\n\nMETRIC                                 VALUE\nAnswer accuracy (pre‑deployment)       ~75%–97%\nA grades (with Jill vs without)        ~66% vs ~62%\nJW‑GPT pass rate vs OpenAI‑Assistant   78.7% vs 30.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> “The Jill Watson upgrade is a leap forward.

however, the studies also documented harmful edge cases and\nstressed the need for human oversight and clear escalation pathways (, ).\n\nFor Indianapolis schools and campus counseling centers, the practical takeaway\nis that a scoped chatbot can provide 24/7 motivational triage and reduce demand\non clinicians - if deployed with auditable escalation protocols, clinician\nhandoffs, and FERPA‑aligned data handling as outlined in local pilot checklists\n().\n\n\nMETRIC                                        VALUE\nParticipants                                  349\nShort‑term confidence gain                    +1.0 to +1.3 (11‑point scale)\nReflection appropriateness (GPT‑4 vs GPT‑2)   ~98% vs ~70%\n\n\n\n\n> “If you could have a good conversation anytime you needed it to help mitigate\n> feelings of anxiety and depression, then that would be a net benefit to\n> humanity and society.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart Sparrow - Personalized Adaptive Learning Platforms\n\n(Up)\n\nSmart Sparrow's adaptive platform gives Indiana instructors granular control to\nbuild active, branched lessons and simulations that meet local course standards\nwhile scaling costly hands‑on experiences - useful for Indianapolis colleges\nthat face lab space and equipment limits.\n\nEducators author “If THIS, then THAT” adaptivity (just‑in‑time hints,\ndifferentiated pathways, and real‑time feedback), deploy through an LMS, and see\nlive analytics to pinpoint misconceptions and intervene before failure;\ndeployments show real gains in engagement and outcomes and practical savings\nsuch as replacing slow manual grading workflows with time‑limited, automatically\nscored adaptive exams.\n\nFor example, Smart Sparrow supports virtual labs, simulations, and adaptive\ntutorials that replicate expensive experiments at lower cost and enable\ninstructors to reclaim instructor hours for high‑impact teaching - so what: a\nsingle adaptive exam workflow has been credited with saving roughly 30 hours of\ninstructor grading per exam while surfacing data to guide interventions.\n\nLearn more in Smart Sparrow's adaptive learning overview, explore institution\ndemos, or review adaptive‑tutorial exam use cases.\n\n\nMETRIC / FEATURE                  VALUE / EXAMPLE\nInstructor control & adaptivity   Designed adaptivity (authoring “If THIS, then THAT” rules)\nReported impact                   Engagement +57%, outcomes +28% (Doherty et al., 2018)\nTime savings example              ~30 hours saved per exam (UNSW adaptive tutorials\n                                  deployment)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> “The adaptive lessons developed using Smart Sparrow improved the pre-class\n> learning experience of my students – both, cognitively and affectively.” - Dr.\n> Autar Kaw\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Alicante - Accessibility with \"Help Me See\" App\n\n(Up)\n\nUniversity of Alicante's accessibility suite - led by the AI‑powered “Help Me\nSee” mobile app - demonstrates practical assistive AI Indianapolis campuses can\nmodel: Help Me See uses computer vision and machine‑learning to assist blind and\nlow‑vision students with navigation and obstacle alerts, building on research\nthat used a phone's 3D camera to warn users of obstacles roughly two meters away\n(); the UA platform also runs Navilens for indoor wayfinding and recently added\nan AI subtitling and transcription tool that generates time‑synced captions with\nprocessing kept on university servers to strengthen multimedia privacy and\ncontrol (, ).\n\nSo what: Indianapolis institutions can replicate this stack to cut accommodation\nwait times, increase campus independence for students with visual or hearing\nimpairments, and maintain local data control as part of FERPA‑aware deployments.\n\n\nTOOL                         CAPABILITY                                            PRIVACY/NOTE\nHelp Me See                  Computer‑vision navigation & obstacle alerts          Mobile on‑device sensing (3D camera research)\nNavilens                     Long‑range, high‑density indoor wayfinding markers    Pilot deployed on UA campus maps\nSubtitling & Transcription   AI‑generated, time‑synced captions for videos/audio   Processing on UA servers for privacy\n\n\n\nJuilliard School - \"Music Mentor\" Performance Feedback Tools\n\n(Up)\n\nJuilliard's conservatory structure - centered on intensive applied training\n(students receive 15 one‑hour studio lessons per semester) and a Pre‑College\npractice‑buddy program where prep percussionists run half‑hour weekly Zoom\nsessions with elementary students - offers a concrete model Indianapolis music\nprograms can mirror when introducing an AI “Music Mentor” that provides instant,\npractice‑level feedback between human touchpoints; so what: pairing quick,\nautomated feedback on rhythm, dynamics, and posture with Juilliard‑style\nfrequent coaching can accelerate deliberate practice cycles and free instructors\nto focus on ensemble work and higher‑order musicianship (see Juilliard's and the\n).\n\nLocal pilots should follow Juilliard's rules for unedited student recordings,\nteacher‑assigned repertoire, and clear audition/assessment timelines so\nautomated feedback remains auditable, FERPA‑aware, and integrated with human\noversight rather than replacing it.\n\n\nFEATURE                       JUILLIARD EXAMPLE\nStudio lessons per semester   \nPrep Division mentoring       \n\n\n\n\n> “The main learning tool of El Sistema is the music ensemble, so having these\n> kids learn to work together is perfect in terms of our theme of connections.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSanta Monica College - AI‑Driven Career and Guidance Systems\n\n(Up)\n\nSanta Monica College models a pragmatic pathway Indianapolis institutions can\nmirror for AI‑driven career and guidance systems: SMC's online EDUC 50 “AI for\nEducators” course - built from Lynn Dickinson's How to Use ChatGPT and which\nfilled its initial 45‑student section within hours and expanded to two sections\n- prepares faculty to teach AI literacy and integrate ethical prompt practices\ninto career advising, while SMC's hands‑on offerings (like the ) and its\ninteraction‑design pipeline create stackable, job‑ready skills; pairing that\nsupply of trained instructors and technical coursework with a campus\ndegree‑planning platform such as (used by large universities including Indiana\nUniversity) lets advisors automate audits, show clear pathways to AI roles, and\nsurface timely alerts so more students can convert interest into employment - so\nwhat: the combined system turns one‑off AI PD into scalable career routing that\nshortens time‑to‑placement while keeping human advisors in the loop.\n\n\nOFFERING                       KEY FACT\nEDUC 50 - AI for Educators     Initial section capacity 45;

Prompts focus on task templates (quiz\ngeneration, rubric creation), targeted student outreach messages,\nmodel‑grounding instructions (reference course materials), ethical escalation\nflows, and accessibility/transcription prompts that keep processing on\ninstitution servers.\n\n\n\nHow were the top 10 use cases and prompts selected for Indiana districts?\n\nSelection prioritized three practical criteria: measurable teacher time savings\nin short pilots, clear FERPA‑aligned data practices, and feasible scaling\nwithout expensive replatforming. Evidence sources included IPS's 20‑staff pilot,\nIndiana's 2023–24 AI‑Powered Platform Pilot Grant results, vendor documentation,\nstate guidance, and professional learning plans. KPIs defined included teacher\nworkload, student equity, and data minimization, and methodology required vendor\nvetting and integration with cloud infrastructure.\n\n\n\nWhat privacy, governance, and training safeguards should Indianapolis schools\nadopt when deploying AI?\n\nAdopt district‑approved tool lists, responsible‑use agreements for staff,\nFERPA/COPPA compliance checks, data minimization rules (prohibit uploading full\nIEPs), vendor contract clauses preventing student data from training external\nmodels, audit logging, an AI advisory board, and monthly PD for pilot\nparticipants. Pair these with targeted professional learning (e.g., 15‑week AI\nEssentials for Work) and a small pilot model (~20 staff) before wider rollout.\n\n\n\nWhat measurable benefits did local pilots and studies show for these AI use\ncases?\n\nReported benefits include concrete teacher time savings (examples: automated\nrubrics and quizzes, ~30 hours saved per exam in adaptive deployments), positive\npilot experiences (Indiana grant: 53% of participating teachers reported\npositive experiences), improved retention when early‑alert models were paired\nwith habit tracking (Ivy Tech: students with six habits were 94% registered for\nspring), and small but measurable gains in student outcomes with virtual\nassistants and adaptive tools (e.g., Jill Watson correlated with modest grade\ngains and higher pass rates).\n\n\n\nHow should an Indianapolis district get started with AI pilots and scale\nresponsibly?\n\nStart with a focused, semester‑long pilot of ~20 staff using district‑approved\ntools (IPS used Google Gemini in Phase 2), set clear KPIs (teacher workload,\nequity, auditability), require vendor vetting and FERPA/COPPA checklists, lock\ncontract terms that prevent student‑data training and require retention limits\nand audit logs, and pair deployments with short, stackable professional learning\n(e.g., 15‑hour microcredentials or a 15‑week bootcamp) so gains are transferable\nand governed.\n\nYou may be interested in the following topics as well:\n\n * See why is critical to preserve meaningful student evaluation in the AI era.\n\n * Learn why robust are essential to manage bias, equity, and legal risk."},bootcamps:[{id:"AW",title:"AI Essentials for Work",metatitle:"AI Essentials for Work Bootcamp: Practical AI Skills for Any Job",length:"15 Weeks",name:"AIEssentials4Work",friendlyid:"ai-essentials-for-work",description:"Gain practical AI skills for any workplace.
