    This page reflects course policy for the Oregon Health &amp; Science
    University (OHSU) course, <i>Introduction to Biomedical &amp;
      Health Informatics</i>. There are versions of this course in
    several OHSU programs, including:<br>

    ChatGPT and generative AI systems based on large language models
    (LLMs) can be a useful tool for learning all kinds of topics,
    including in biomedical and health informatics. These tools should
    not, however, be used to substitute one’s own knowledge. Students
    can “converse” with ChatGPT or generative AI systems to get ideas
    for answers to questions, but the final responses to discussion
    forums, quiz and test questions, and the term paper, should reflect
    their own thinking, judgment, and language.<br>

    I recently published a <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01251-0">peer-reviewed

      paper</a> showing that ChatGPT and other LLMs can "pass" the
    knowledge-assessment portions of this course, which was summarized
    in an <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://news.ohsu.edu/2024/09/16/ohsu-researchers-test-chatgpt-other-ai-models-against-real-world-students">OHSU

      news release</a>. This policy is based in part on the results of
    this study.<br>
    <br>
    <i>It is critically important that students not "shortchange" their
      learning by being overly reliant on generative AI systems. While
      most scientific fields have long surpassed the amount of knowledge
      that can be maintained in a human brain, it is important to have a
      fundamental core of knowledge and understanding in memory to be
      able to apply critical thinking to problems and analyses. In
      addition, just as students must attribute use of papers, books,
      and other sources in their work, they must also attribute use of
      generative AI when it is used in discussion forums or assignments.</i><br>
    <br>
    This policy is derived from the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://o2.ohsu.edu/teaching-and-learning-center/academic-integrity">overall









      OHSU policy for academic integrity</a>, including the use of AI.
    The <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/medical-informatics-and-clinical-epidemiology/biomedical-informatics-graduate">OHSU









      Biomedical Informatics Graduate Program</a> is developing a
    general policy for use of generative AI in courses, but in the
    meantime, I have adopted the following guidelines for course
    activities:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Discussion forums</b> - the purpose of the discussion
        forums is for students to discuss issues that elaborate on unit
        course materials. Individual forum postings are not graded,
        although a component of the course grade is based on
        participation in the forums, comparable to what used to be
        participation in live classrooms. While students can “converse”
        with generative AI to get ideas for responses to forum
        questions, what is actually posted in the forum by students
        should represent their own ideas, language, and thought
        processes.</li>
      <li><b>Homework self-assessment</b> - students can ask generative
        AI about topics mentioned in the multiple-choice questions but
        are expected to answer the questions based on their own
        knowledge of materials covered in the lectures and not use
        generative AI with the questions themselves until after they
        have submitted their answers to the questions.</li>
      <li><b>Term paper/project</b> - students can ask generative AI for
        help in brainstorming about their term paper/project. Generative
        AI systems do not write long papers, and their output tends to
        focus on generalities and may be prone to confabulation,
        especially in generating references. The 10-15 term
        paper/project should have a focus on a specific topic, and delve
        into it with coherent discussion and ample references, including
        recent ones, as outlined in the course syllabus.</li>
      <li><b>Final exam</b> - students must not access generative AI
        during the final exam, just as they may not consult other humans
        during the open-book exams that is given.</li>
    </ul>
    If you are a student and have a question on whether use of
    generative AI is appropriate, please <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="mailto:hersh@ohsu.edu">reach out directly to me</a> (email
    is best for initial contact).<br>
    <br>
    As a guiding principle, we expect and require that all work
    submitted be the student's own, original work. When considering
    using such a generative AI tool, students should ask themselves:
    Will the tool’s output be something I will be turning in directly?
    In general, students may use such tools as a source of information,
    but not to produce output that they intend to turn in or as a
    replacement for a traditional cited reference.<br>
    <br>
    Most ethical and conduct policies in our informatics educational
    programs, and in the work we subsequently do as professionals, are
    enforced through an <b>honor code</b>. We recognize we cannot
    police all inappropriate use of AI or other activities. We hope that
    students will find ways to use LLMs to enhance their learning but
    not substitute for or become dependent on it.<br>
