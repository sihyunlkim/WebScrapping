<meta name="description" content="This research explores how advanced artificial intelligence (AI), like the technology that powers tools such as ChatGPT, is changing the way we teach and learn in schools and universities. Imagine AI helping to summarize thick legal documents into something you can read over a coffee break or helping students learn how to code by offering personalized guidance. We looked into how teachers feel about using these AI tools in their classrooms, what kind of rules schools have about them, and how they can make learning programming easier for students. We found that most teachers are excited about the possibilities but also a bit cautious because they want to make sure these tools are used fairly and safely. There’s also a lot that schools need to figure out in terms of setting up the right rules to make the best use of AI. Our study suggests that if we can address these challenges, AI could make education more engaging, accessible, and effective for everyone. It’s a call to educators, policymakers, and tech developers to work together to ensure AI tools are used in ways that benefit all students and help prepare them for a future where technology plays an even bigger role in our lives.">

<p>This research explores how advanced artificial intelligence (AI), like the technology that powers tools such as ChatGPT, is changing the way we teach and learn in schools and universities. Imagine AI helping to summarize thick legal documents into something you can read over a coffee break or helping students learn how to code by offering personalized guidance. We looked into how teachers feel about using these AI tools in their classrooms, what kind of rules schools have about them, and how they can make learning programming easier for students. We found that most teachers are excited about the possibilities but also a bit cautious because they want to make sure these tools are used fairly and safely. There’s also a lot that schools need to figure out in terms of setting up the right rules to make the best use of AI. Our study suggests that if we can address these challenges, AI could make education more engaging, accessible, and effective for everyone. It’s a call to educators, policymakers, and tech developers to work together to ensure AI tools are used in ways that benefit all students and help prepare them for a future where technology plays an even bigger role in our lives.</p>
