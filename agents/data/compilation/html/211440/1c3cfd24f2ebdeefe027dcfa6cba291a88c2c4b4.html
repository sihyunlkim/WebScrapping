                            <p>Carnegie Mellon University has been at the epicenter of artificial intelligence since creating the first AI computer program in 1956. As that pioneering work continues today in directions such as autonomous vehicles and natural language processing, CMU experts are advancing the leading edge of technology that is impacting every corner of society.</p>
<p>Throughout the summer and fall, CMU faculty and leaders conducted AI policy briefings with state, national and international decision-makers on fast-paced changes in the field and to provide insight on its fair use and benefits to society. They led conversations in Washington, D.C. and New York City with key federal agencies, U.S. Congressional committees and the 78th United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>Here are highlights of those briefings.</p>

Josh Shapiro to the university&#8217;s Pittsburgh campus to sign an executive order establishing responsible standards and a governance framework for generative AI use by commonwealth agencies. The executive order will ensure the commonwealth is using the technology in a way that benefits all Pennsylvanians &#8212; from helping improve public health services to creating meaningful employment opportunities.</p>
<p>The event also marked a new collaborative agreement between the Shapiro administration and CMU dedicated to promoting the responsible use of AI tools. The administration will partner with the Block Center for Technology and Society to create opportunities for the commonwealth to leverage faculty expertise and receive advisory support for the Generative AI Governance Board, created by the order, as well as foster additional research support and collaboration on generative AI usage.</p>

<p>Organizers included Ghani; <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/jodi-forlizzi" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jodi Forlizzi</a>, the Herbert A. Simon Professor in Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction in the School of Computer Science; and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/&#126;hheidari/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hoda Heidari</a>, the K&amp;L Gates Career Development Assistant Professor in Ethics and Computational Technologies in the School of Computer Science.</p>
<p>The result of a broad collaboration between public and private sectors, the framework provides guidelines to better manage the potential risks of AI systems at all levels of society. Its voluntary use can help integrate trustworthiness into AI by considering how systems are designed, developed, used and evaluated.</p>
