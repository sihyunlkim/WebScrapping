<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The following considerations were developed by colleagues in the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to dig deeper, here are some key considerations when responsibly using generative AI tools such as ChatGPT.&#160; Doing so requires attention to privacy and security, ownership, bias, validity, and context.&#160; You can consider using these as seed prompts of things like policy discussions or usability assessments of existing tools.&#160;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><strong>Privacy and security</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> concerns include confidentiality and potential for data breaches. Does the tool allow your private data to leak? Does it allow you to acquire other people's private data? Is the system that you're running the tool on secure? Are you sure the tool itself is legitimate?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><strong>Ownership </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">considerations include the provenance of generated content. Is any of the content copyright protected? Can you copyright the generated content? Can a student claim the generated content as their own?&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><strong>Bias</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> relates to the potential for drawing conclusions that may be prejudiced or discriminatory due to the training data not being representative.&#160; Can you tell what data the tool was trained on?&#160; Are there categories of people (age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation) that may be under-represented in the training data?&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><strong>Validity</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> concerns relate to the trust placed in the output of the tool. How does one review generated content for factuality or other forms of validity (perhaps realism, in the case of images)? Does correctness of the answer depend on having more recent data than the data used to train the tool?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><strong>Context.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Are some tasks more or less suitable for use with the tool - for example, generating an email may be less problematic than generating an essay or doing data analysis? Will the output of the tool be used by people who may not understand the limitations of generative AI or the data it is trained on? Can students and instructors use the tool without citation? What skills are appropriate to delegate to the tool?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Other considerations.</strong>&#160; Cost, including recurring costs through subscriptions; Liability (FERPA, student privacy concerns, vetted software); and more. Careful consideration of these questions is required before using generative AI in the classroom.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a id="activities"></a>Examples of in-class exercises, activities or assignments using ChatGPT</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The following examples were developed by colleagues in the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy.</em></span></p>
                                                                         <h2 class="collapsed">Challenge exercise: Who does ChatGPT think you are?</h2>
                        <div>
                <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why this matters</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This exercise demonstrates some of the limitations of ChatGPT - namely, that because of the way that it generates answers, they are partly based on probabilities of things like word order in previous source information. The result is that for information that isn&#8217;t widely known or discussed in the training data, the tool will try to fill in the blanks.&#160; When this happens for a person&#8217;s biographies, the results are likely very divergent from reality.&#160;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time to complete: 15-20 minutes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divide the students into teams of two or three.&#160; If students are likely to know each other, use the Groups feature on Canvas to randomly assign groups of two or three students each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instructions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have each student introduce themselves to the other (sharing nothing more than their name), and write down the name of the other student(s). Note: make sure the students understand using their real names is optional.&#160; If they don&#8217;t feel comfortable, have them make up an entirely fictitious name.&#160; Or, ask them to select an obscure topic, location, or thing that they know a lot about.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using ChatGPT, have each student ask the program who the classmate is.&#160; They can use any prompt they feel is appropriate.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new &#8220;bio&#8221;, each student should now introduce the other, using the information from the bio.&#160; What did it get right?&#160; What did it get wrong?&#160; Why?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students can continue asking questions.&#160; What does the person like to eat?&#160; What are their favorite sports?&#160; What did they do before coming to CMU?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After everyone has had a chance to share within the group, come back together and discuss. Ask the students if they would feel comfortable using this as their bio on LinkedIn or on a cover letter.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a list of strengths and weaknesses of using ChatGPT.&#160; This can be a good time to share how on the surface the information might appear trustworthy until you go back to the original source.&#160; Ask the students to discuss what this might mean when using ChatGPT to research topics they are less familiar with.&#160;</span></li>
</ol>
            </div>
                                                             <h2 class="collapsed">Challenge exercise: Flash brief (aka ChatGPT karaoke)!</h2>
                        <div>
                <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why this matters:&#160;</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this exercise we demonstrate the ability of ChatGPT to generate a &#8220;flash brief&#8221; on a critical, timely topic. Builds on this idea of &#8220;ChatGPT Karaoke&#8221;.&#160; By introducing a fair amount of uncomfort by trying to present content generated by ChatGPT, students should recognize its limitations when used as an unvarnished generative tool.&#160;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time to complete: 45 minutes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divide the students into teams of four.&#160; Before class, give each group a policy brief topic to become familiar with.&#160; A good source is the Day One Project:&#160;</span></p>

<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instructions - Generative AI team</span></h4>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using ChatGPT (or other tool identified by the instructor), develop prompts to create the Flash Brief</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using only the content developed by the tool, create the policy brief.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Present the policy brief</span></li>
</ol>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instructions - Traditional research team</span></h4>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research the topic as normal</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop the policy brief</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Present the policy brief</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the presentations are complete, discuss!&#160; What are the strengths and weaknesses of each approach?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instructors, this is a good time to talk about how it can be hard for generative AI tools to be specific, accurate, or appropriate for the audience. But, it&#8217;s also worth noting how it can be helpful for developing ideas around language, approach, and brainstorming.&#160;</span></p>
            </div>
                                                             <h2 class="collapsed">Challenge exercise: How do I earn an A on this assignment? </h2>
                        <div>
                <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why this matters:&#160;</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This classroom exercise is motivated by providing students with practice and feedback to develop challenging skills with the support of your assignment rubric and ChatGPT. Research shows that the following teaching strategies support learning:&#160;</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">providing transparent evaluation criteria in advance,</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively engaging students with examples that illustrate effective habits of mind, and&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">creating opportunities for targeted low-stakes practice and feedback.&#160;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common ways instructors enact these strategies include:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">providing and discussing the grading rubric with students prior to completing assignments,</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">providing anonymized examples of work from previous students, representing a range of quality, and</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">classroom exercises during which students individually or collaboratively evaluate anonymized samples of student work using the assignment rubric and then engage in a class discussion to enhance their understanding of criteria and explore how to improve the samples.&#160;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI Tools provide additional opportunities to implement these strategies and foster student development and learning, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">without</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring access to or curation of examples of prior student work.&#160;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time to complete during class: 60 minutes*</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Note: To shorten the activity, the initial segment marked with an asterisk (*) in the instructions below could be assigned as pre-class, individual work.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set-up:&#160;</span></h2>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before class, enter your assignment prompt into ChatGPT. Evaluate the output using your assignment rubric to familiarize yourself with pros and cons of the deliverables it produces. Also consider testing tweaks to the assignment prompt.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divide the students into teams of three or four.&#160;&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide students with the assignment prompt and assignment rubric in Canvas.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide each group with a set of 4 notecards each labeled with a large visible letter, &#8220;A&#8221;, &#8220;B&#8221;, &#8220;C&#8221; or &#8220;D&#8221;.&#160;&#160;</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instructions for classroom exercise:</span></h2>
<p><strong>1. (10 min*) Group work. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask students to read and discuss the assignment prompt and grading rubric in their groups to identify and prioritize clarification questions. Groups can enter their questions in a Google Doc that the instructor can monitor and respond to in real time. Provide each group with a dedicated space in the document to write.</span></p>
<p><strong>2. (10 min) Whole class discussion.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solicit any remaining high priority clarification questions from each group and discuss.&#160;</span></p>

                        <div>
                <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why this matters:&#160;</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research shows that implementing active learning during class sessions improves both learning outcomes and student persistence. However, designing materials for classroom exercises can be time consuming. This approach leverages AI Tools to generate the examples students work on during class, in real time. The premise underlying the practice exercise is that students must find, explain, and correct any errors generated by AI Tools. The sample below focuses on coding/debugging skills. However, it could be adapted for practicing writing or other skills.&#160;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time to complete during class: 25 minutes</span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set-up:&#160;</span></h2>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before class, pilot test prompts in ChatGPT that will purposefully generate output containing an error. For example, generate a block of code in [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">insert coding language here</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">] to do X, Y, and Z, but that contains at least one error that will prevent it from running successfully.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repeat step 1 above, with different X, Y, and Z functions, as needed.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divide the students into teams of two.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randomly assign tested prompts to student pairs.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optional: consider adding a scenario to make things more interesting.&#160; For example: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;ve been tasked with figuring out if a work sample provided by a potential new hire is a real reflection of their coding ability.&#160; Can you figure out the real, working code from the sample generated by AI?&#8221;</span></i></li>

                <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why this matters</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This assignment is designed for Writing for Public Policy course, but could easily be adapted for any course that deals with public policy, client consulting, or communicating cutting edge content.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This discussion prompt attempts to give students a real world scenario to consider about how ChatGPT use (or any other generative AI platform) might impact their professional work. Heinz students are often very focused on professional development and industry expectations, so discussions about the downsides of generative AI in an academic setting might not be as effective as how those downsides might manifest in a professional context.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By placing the students in a managerial position, it gives them the opportunity to reflect on complications for this kind of AI misuse in multiple directions in a professional hierarchy. The ethics of this situation are intentionally difficult and there is likely not a single good answer, but the intention is to get students to reflect on both the misuse of ChatGPT as well as professional ethos, the need for good research/citation practices, and communication of expectations in a managerial setting.&#160;</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prompt</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are a policy analyst at a major policy think tank in Pittsburgh. Yesterday, on short notice, the think tank was asked by a local representative </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[insert city, state, or national figure here as is relevant] </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to brief them on current issues involving </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[insert topic related to course material here].</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Your boss assigned you to attend the meeting today, brief the policy maker and determine what kind of help the think tank can provide moving forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As is the regular practice at the think tank,&#160; you ask the interns to pull together research and create a 1 page policy briefing document. One of the interns, Brad, sent you the 1 pager late last night. After glancing through the document quickly first thing this morning, you forwarded it to the policy maker and their staff.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You arrived early for the meeting and while waiting in the conference room for the policy maker to arrive, you take a few moments to read through the briefing document more thoroughly. You decide to read through some of the references to get a deeper understanding of the material but when you click on the link to the first one, it comes up as a 404 error. You click on the second reference link and get a similar error. With a sinking feeling, you click through the rest of the references and realize that none of them actually link to content.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You pull out your phone and quickly message Brad in Slack to ask if there is an issue with the hyperlinks. After a quick exchange, Brad admits, &#8220;I was really pressed for time last night, so I used ChatGPT to write the brief. I didn&#8217;t double check the references but now that I&#8217;m looking at it, I think ChatGPT made them all up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did you double check that all the numbers and statistics in the briefing are accurate?&#8221; you write back.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a very long pause. You can hear people outside of the conference room; the policy maker and staff are preparing to enter the conference room for the meeting.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I just googled the first three statistics listed in the document and it looks like they are incorrect&#8221; Brad writes back. &#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry. I think the whole document is likely bad information.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the policy maker enters the room. &#8220;Thank you so much for coming on short notice! I&#8217;m eager to hear what you have to say about this topic.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possible Discussion Questions</span></h2>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you do? What actions do you take in this immediate moment? (Cancel the meeting? Ask the staff to disregard the briefing document? Apologize?)&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How would you explain the situation to the policy maker? To your boss?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is at fault in this situation?&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What impact might these actions have on your reputation and the reputation of your company?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a manager, what should you have done differently?&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a manager, what steps do you need to take to address this situation with Brad the intern? What consequences should he face?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an employee of the think tank, how can you ensure this situation does not happen to any other policy analysts? What policies or procedures might you recommend to upper management?</span></li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instructions&#160;</span></h2>
<p><strong>Think-Pair-Share discussion in class</strong></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read through the prompt with the class and give the students time to brainstorm their responses individually to the questions (alternatively, you could provide the prompt and have the students read and respond individually for homework)</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask the students to share their responses with a partner in the class and discuss their reactions.&#160;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Discussion with team deliverable</strong></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read through the prompt with the class.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk through a few discussion questions with the class, giving them an opportunity to dig in to the ideas. Use the questions that focus on the outcomes you are trying to emphasize.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Break the team into small groups (2-3) and ask them to draft a deliverable document. You can choose one that best fits your course goals or allow students to choose one. They will not be able to complete more than one in class.&#160;</span>
<ol>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deliverable prompt 1: In a small group, work to draft an email to Brad the intern which outlines the issues with the brief he delivered. This email should include guidelines on drafting a brief, guidelines for proper use of AI technology, and the consequences (if any) resulting from this incident.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deliverable prompt 2: In a small group, draft an email to all the interns at the policy think tank. This email should issue guidelines on the use of AI (especially ChatGPT) when composing documents at work. Your group may decide whether or not to disclose the incident that prompted these guidelines. Your group may also decide what kinds of consequences would be offered for violating this new policy</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deliverable prompt 3: In a small group, draft an email/after action report to your boss at the think tank, giving her a full accounting of the incident. Your email will need to include relevant details about the incident, the steps you have/will take, proposed consequences for the intern and/or for you, and recommendations for new policies or procedures moving forward.&#160;</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have completed your draft, submit the deliverable to the discussion board for today.&#160;</span>
<ol>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, you can have the students brainstorm their solutions together and then ask each student to draft and turn in a deliverable as a homework assignment.</span></li>
