<H1>Carnegie Mellon University Systems Courses, Fall 2024:
Academic Integrity Policy
</H1>

The following policy applies to courses based on the textbook
<a href = "http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu"><em>Computer Systems: A Programmer's
Approach</em></a> (CS:APP) taught at <a href="www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon
University</a>.  These include the following:
<dl>
<dt><b>Computer Systems</b></dt>
<dd>
15-213, 18-213, 14-513, 15-513, and 18-613
</dd>
</dl>


All of these courses are subject to the
<A HREF="https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html">university policy on academic integrity.</A>
Courses in CIT (18-213, 14-513 and 18-613) are also subject to the
<A HREF="https://engineering.cmu.edu/education/academic-policies/academic-integrity.html">CIT
policy on academic integrity.</A>  This document describes policy
issues specific to these courses.
<p>
All of these courses have adopted the same standards as to what
constitutes an Academic Integrity Violation (AIV).  As is noted in the
section below titled &ldquo;Enforcement,&rdquo; there may be course-specific
guidelines regarding the possible penalties when an infraction occurs.  Consult
the syllabus for your course to get further information on penalties.

<h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
Our policy is based on the following beliefs, gained through many years of experience:
<ul>
<li>Understanding the operation and implementation of computer systems
is best learned by hands-on activities: writing, debugging, measuring, and
exercising programs that expose the relevant system principles.
<li>Developing programs from scratch, or with limited starting code,
requires using design principles and logical thinking that are much
deeper than can be gained by copying and modifying an existing
implementation.  Making use of unauthorized sources
diminishes the educational value of an assignment.
<li>Although teamwork and collaboration are important real-world
skills, it is important to first gain the core
competencies that enable individuals to serve as effective team members.
These courses are designed to teach and assess these core
competencies. Unauthorized collaboration diminishes the
educational experience and the reliability of our assessments.
</ul>

Based on these principles, we provide the following guidelines on what
forms of resource use, resource sharing, and collaboration are
permitted in these course.

<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>
Each exam must be the sole work of the student taking it.
No collaboration of any form is allowed on exams.  Students may not
discuss any aspect of any exam question with someone who has not yet taken
the exam.
<p>

<h2>Labs and Other Assignments</h2>

<h3>While You Are Taking the Class</h3>

As a general principle, you may not obtain any information about an
assignment from an unauthorized source.  The following provide
clarifications as to which sources are authorized, and which are not.

<dl>
  <dt><b>Copying:</b></dt>
  <ul>
  <li>You <b>may</b> use material that we explicitly provide you for the assignment.  No attribution is required.
  <li>You <b>may</b> use other course material, including lectures, Piazza posts by the instructors, and material from the course website.
  For any such use involving code, you must provide clear attribution, indicating the source, and where the included material begins and ends.
  <li>You <b>may</b> use any material from the CS:APP book, any other course textbook, or  the <a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu">CS:APP web site</a>.
  For any such use involving code, you must provide clear attribution, indicating the source, and where the included material begins and ends.
  <li>Beyond this, you <B>may not</b> obtain code or other solution information,
  either by copying, retyping, or looking at files or documents from any of the above-listed courses for
  this semester, or a previous semester.
  <li>You <b>may not</b> obtain code or other solution information from an unauthorized external source, including web pages, code repositories, blog posts, etc.
  </ul>

<dt><b>Searching:</b></dt>
<ul>
<li>You <b>may</b> search for or refer to general information, including the use of systems, networks, compilers, debuggers, profilers, and program libraries.
<li>You <b>may not</b> search the Web for solutions or for any advice on how to solve an assignment.
</ul>

<dt><b>Reusing:</b></dt>
<ul>
<li>You <b>may</b> reuse
  elements of general knowledge from prior courses.  For example, you may use existing
  code for a linked list or to process commandline
  arguments.
  For any such use involving code, you must provide clear attribution, indicating the source, and where the included material begins and ends.
<li>
If you have worked on one of the labs from CS:APP, either at CMU, at
some other school, or on your own, please arrange a meeting with one
of the instructors at the beginning of the term to devise a policy on
which parts of your solutions you may use.  <em>Reuse without explicit permission of an instructor, even if it's your own code, is forbidden</em>.
</ul>

<dt><b>Using other's code or documents:</b></dt>
<ul>
  <li> You <b>may not</b> look at someone else's code (or other documents.)
  This includes one person looking at code and
  describing it to another.  There is no notion of looking &ldquo;too
  much,&rdquo; since no looking is allowed at all.
  <li>You <b>may not</b> make use of any information about the labs posted online, except for the authorized sources listed above.
</dd>
</dl>

<dt><b>Assistance:</b></dt>
<ul>
<li>You <b>may</b> get assistance on an assignment from the instructors, course staff, and university tutors.
<li>You <b>may only</b> get high-level, strategic advice from others, including current and former students, and people external to the university.
Forbidden forms of advice include:
anything more detailed than a brief verbal description or
block diagram, any kind of code or pseudo-code,
explicit directions on how to assemble
allowed blocks of code, and code-level debugging assistance.
</ul>


<h3>From Now and Into the Future</h3>

As a general principle, you may not provide detailed help with an
assignment to students this semester or in future semesters for any of
the above-listed courses (unless you are serving as a teaching
assistant or instructor for the course.)  The following are
clarifications about which forms of aid are authorized and which are
not.  Note that they apply to <em>all</em> of the above listed courses
and <em>from now and into the indefinite future</em>.

<dl>
<dt><b>Sharing:</b></dt>
<dd>
You <b>may not</b> supply a copy of a file or document to an individual student or via a public channel, such as a blog post.
</dd>

<dt><b>Providing access:</b></dt>
<dd>
You <b>may not</b> have any of your
 solution files in unprotected
  directories or in unprotected code repositories, either by putting files in an unprotected location or by allowing protections to lapse.
  Be sure to store your work in protected directories, and log off
  when you leave an open cluster, to prevent others from copying your
  work.  If you make use of a code
  repository, such as Github, make sure your work is kept private,
  even after you have left CMU.
</dd>

<dt><b>Coaching, Assisting, and Collaborating:</b></dt>
<ul>
<li>You <b>may not</b> provide electronic, verbal, or written descriptions of code or other solution information.
<li>You <b>may</b> clarify ambiguities or vague points in class handouts or textbooks.
<li>You <b>may</b> help others use the computer systems, networks,
compilers, debuggers, profilers, code libraries, and other system facilities.
<li>You <b>may</b> discuss and provide general, strategic advice about
an assignment.  Providing anything more detailed than a brief
description or a block diagram is not allowed.  Providing any kind of
code or pseudo-code is not allowed.  Providing explicit directions on
how to assemble allowed blocks of code is forbidden.
<li>You <b>may</b> provide suggestions of potential bugs based on high-level symptoms.  Code-based debugging assistance is forbidden.
</ul>

<h2>Enforcement</h2>

We will aggressively employ cheat checkers and other means to detect
unauthorized use of code from this term, previous terms, and available
online.  All infractions will lead to formal reporting of an AIV to
the university and to the program.  The standard penalty will be to be
given a failing grade for the course.  Lesser penalties may occur,
depending on the nature of the infraction.  <b>Consult the syllabus
for your course for any additional information regarding penalties.</b>



<h2>No Statute of Limitations</h2>

The above stated rules apply even after your have completed the
course.  You may not share code you have written for this course with
future students.  That means you cannot leave your code in unprotected
repositories or post it on any web page.  You may not provide coaching
to future students.  We can and will file AIV reports for students who
have already completed the course, possibly changing their grades.
