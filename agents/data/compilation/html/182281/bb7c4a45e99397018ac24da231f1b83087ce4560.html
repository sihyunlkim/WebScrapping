<meta name="description" content="GenAI obliges educators to rethink assignments and activities. Gamification provides educators with ways to increase student engagement, supplying instructors with tools to facilitate students’ journey toward GenAI fluency. This interactive workshop explores ways to leverage the power of GenAI to engage learners in a fun and familiar way. Experience firsthand a taste of the critical thinking and problem-solving skills advanced in a GenAI role-playing game. Sample GenAI fluency in the safe learning environment that students need. Attendees will play an abridged version of The Case of the Inept AI Detective. GenAI plays a character in this game rather than it being used to develop or code the game. Through the gameplay and post-game debriefing, attendees will discover an innovative way to create games that support students’ ethical and responsible use of GenAI and promote GenAI fluency, while showcasing students’ authentic learning. Along the way participants will gain a deeper insight into GenAI literacy and how and why fluency is a step beyond literacy. Participants will discover how students’ self-reflections, coupled with applying knowledge, can lead to becoming the better strategic planners and open-minded decision-makers necessary as we move forward in a GenAI-human integrated world. Additionally, gamifying GenAI promotes 21st century skills by challenging students to think outside the GenAI box and develop ethical and equitable solutions during gameplay.
Takeaways:   
Gaining a greater understanding of GenAI’s benefits and limitation   
Recognizing ways to leverage the power of GenAI effectively

<p>GenAI obliges educators to rethink assignments and activities. Gamification provides educators with ways to increase student engagement, supplying instructors with tools to facilitate students’ journey toward GenAI fluency. This interactive workshop explores ways to leverage the power of GenAI to engage learners in a fun and familiar way. Experience firsthand a taste of the critical thinking and problem-solving skills advanced in a GenAI role-playing game. Sample GenAI fluency in the safe learning environment that students need. Attendees will play an abridged version of The Case of the Inept AI Detective. GenAI plays a character in this game rather than it being used to develop or code the game. Through the gameplay and post-game debriefing, attendees will discover an innovative way to create games that support students’ ethical and responsible use of GenAI and promote GenAI fluency, while showcasing students’ authentic learning. Along the way participants will gain a deeper insight into GenAI literacy and how and why fluency is a step beyond literacy.

	<p class="summary">Gamifying Generative AI to Facilitate Students’ Development of GenAI Fluency</p>



	<p class="description"><p>GenAI obliges educators to rethink assignments and activities. Gamification provides educators with ways to increase student engagement, supplying instructors with tools to facilitate students’ journey toward GenAI fluency. This interactive workshop explores ways to leverage the power of GenAI to engage learners in a fun and familiar way. Experience firsthand a taste of the critical thinking and problem-solving skills advanced in a GenAI role-playing game. Sample GenAI fluency in the safe learning environment that students need. Attendees will play an abridged version of The Case of the Inept AI Detective. GenAI plays a character in this game rather than it being used to develop or code the game. Through the gameplay and post-game debriefing, attendees will discover an innovative way to create games that support students’ ethical and responsible use of GenAI and promote GenAI fluency, while showcasing students’ authentic learning. Along the way participants will gain a deeper insight into GenAI literacy and how and why fluency is a step beyond literacy. Participants will discover how students’ self-reflections, coupled with applying knowledge, can lead to becoming the better strategic planners and open-minded decision-makers necessary as we move forward in a GenAI-human integrated world. Additionally, gamifying GenAI promotes 21st century skills by challenging students to think outside the GenAI box and develop ethical and equitable solutions during gameplay.</p>
<p>Takeaways:  <ul> <li></p>
<p>Gaining a greater understanding of GenAI’s benefits and limitation  </li> <li></p>
<p>Recognizing ways to leverage the power of GenAI effectively  </li> <li></p>
<p>Tips for teaching GenAI ethics  </li> <li></p>
<p>How gamification promote GenAI literacy and authentic learning  </li> </ul></p>
