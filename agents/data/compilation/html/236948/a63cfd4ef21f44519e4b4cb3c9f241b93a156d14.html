        <h3 class="aftersec">What is Generative AI?</h3>

        <p>
          Generative AI refers to a kind of artifical intelligence software
          that is capable of getting information in response to prompts.
          The software is trained on source data, and uses that training data
          as input to a sophisticated model that predicts the appropriate
          response to the prompt.
          It does not understand the prompts, but it produces a convincing
          simulation of understanding.
          Examples of generative AI systems that use text include ChatGPT and
          Bard, and generative AI models capable of generating images include
          Midjourney and DALL-E.

        <h3 class="aftersec">Risks of Generative AI</h3>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Accuracy:</b> If you are using generative AI tools
            for learning then you should always double-check the content.
            For example, if you are assigned to write a program that uses a
            specific algorithm, AI tools may generate a solution that arrives
            at the correct answer but does not use the required algorithm.
            If you use generative AI to assist in the creation of assessed
            content then you are responsible for the accuracy and correctness
            of the work that you submit.
          </li>

            <li><b>Quality:</b> Content generated may be of poor quality,
              and generic in nature.
              Code may have security flaws and may contain bugs.
              It is important that you understand how any generated code works
              and you evaluate the quality of the content.
            </li>

            <li><b>Learning:</b> Generative AI can be a powerful productivity
              tool for users who are already familiar with the topic of the
              generated content because they can evaluate and revise the
              content as appropriate.
              Tasks assigned by your teachers are designed to help you learn,
              and relying on AI tools to complete tasks denies you the
              opportunity to learn, and to receive accurate feedback on your
              learning.
            </li>

            <li><b>Over-reliance:</b> Using AI tools to do your work for you
              may achieve the short-term goal of assignment completion, but
              consistent over-reliance on AI tools may prevent you from being
              prepared for later examinations, subsequent coursework, or
              future job opportunities.
            </li>

            <li><b>Motivation:</b> Some students may experience lack of
              motivation for tasks that generative AI can complete.
              It is important to understand that you need to master simple
              tasks (which generative AI can complete) before you can solve
              more complex problems (which generative AI cannot complete).
              Stay motivated!

        <section id="impact">
        <h3 class="aftersec">Impact on others</h3>

        <p>
          There are many consequences to inappropriate usage of AI tools.
          Some of these consequences may be unintended, and could potentially
          harm others.
          For example:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Other students:</b> You could expose other students to harm
            by preventing their learning or including content in a group
            assignment that violates academic integrity.
          </li>
          <li><b>Faculty:</b> Violating academic integrity standards through
            the use of AI tools requires time and energy, and is emotionally
            draining to teachers and administrators, to enforce these
            standards.
          </li>
          <li><b>Institutional:</b> Including code from AI tools that you do
            not understand could expose the university to loss of reputation or
            even financial harm through lawsuits.
          </li>

        <p>
          Despite the risks of using AI tools, you will use them in industry
          after graduation at your job. Therefore, you should learn to use
          them appropriately so you receive the most long-term benefit. As a
          student, these uses are mostly centered on helping you understand
          course material. This includes asking generative AI to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Explain a given topic, or to provide an example of how programming constructs are used.</li>
          <li>Explain your program one line at a time.</li>
          <li>Produce an example that is similar to assignment questions.</li>
          <li>Explain the meaning of error messages.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="alert alert-success" role ="alert">
          <p>An example of a prompt that is perfectly okay to ask is "Why does increasing the associativity of
            a cache cause a decrease in conflict misses?" In this case, such an answer from the prompt allows for the student 
            to <b>understand a particular concept</b>, which can help further their understanding of it in the course.</p>

        <h3 class="aftersec">Examples of inappropriate use</h3>
        <p>
          There are often times when using AI tools are not permitted. Examples of these uses are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Asking generative AI to complete an assignment for you
              that you were meant to complete.</li>

          <li>Using AI tools on official assessments where uses have been
            expressly forbidden, such as invigilated exams where the
            purpose is to determine your individual understanding of
            the material.</li>

          <li>Writing a code solution in a language you know and then
            asking an AI tool to translate that code into the language
            required for the assignment. In this case, part of the assignment's
            value to your learning is to better understand the required language,
            which you would be missing out on.</li>

          <li>Any use that may prevent your personal academic growth
            or may prevent you from understanding a topic or idea.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="alert alert-danger" role = "alert">
          On the other hand, prompts that deal with solving parts your lab/homework are not permitted.
