FERPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. This law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span><span><span><span>It is Institute policy to annually inform individuals attending educational institutions of students’ rights under FERPA. Students’ rights include the right to inspect and review their education records; to request the amendment of their education records; to provide written consent before the Institution discloses personally identifiable information from their education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent; and to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education.</span></span></span></span></p>

	<br>
	<span><span><span><span>Under FERPA, students have the right to inspect and review their education records within 45 days of the day the Institution receives the request for access.</span></span></span></span><br>
	<br>
	<span><span><span><span>A student is any person who is or has been in attendance at an educational institution.</span></span></span></span><br>
	<br>
	<span><span><span><span>Education records are any records that are directly related to the student and maintained by an educational institute or an agent of the Institution. Such records include information recorded in any way, such as typewritten, handwritten,</span></span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span><span>computer‑generated, video, audio, film, microfilm, microfiche or e‑mail.</span></span></span></span><br>
	<br>
	<span><span><span><span>Students do not have the right to inspect and review the following information:</span></span></span></span>

		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Records kept in the sole possession of the maker thereof that are used only as a personal memory aid, and are not accessible or revealed to any other individual except a temporary substitute for the maker of the record.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Records that are created or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting or assisting in their professional capacity and created, maintained, or used only in connection with the provision of treatment to the student and not disclosed to anyone other than</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span><span>individuals providing that treatment. However, the student may have those records reviewed by a physician or other appropriate professional of the student’s choice.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Grades on peer‑graded papers before they are collected and recorded by an instructor.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Records relating to a student who is employed by an educational agency or institution as long as the individual is not employed as a result of his or her status as a student. The records must be made and maintained in the normal course of business and relate exclusively to the individual in that individual’s capacity as an employee.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Records created for a law enforcement purpose by a law enforcement unit of an educational institution and maintained by the law enforcement unit.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Records created or received by an educational institution after the individual is no longer attending the institution and that are not directly related to the individual’s attendance as a student.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Financial records, including any information those records contain, of the parents of a student.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Confidential letters and statements of recommendation placed in the student’s education records after July 1, 1975 and to which the student has waived the right to review and access as long as the waiver is made in writing and signed by the student. The waiver may be used for confidential letters or statement of recommendation</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span><span>that relate to the student’s admission to the Institution, application for employment, or receipt of an honor or honorary recognition.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Institution may not require the waiver as a condition for admission to or receipt of any service or benefit from the Institution. If the student chooses to waive his or her right of access, he or she will be notified, upon request, of the names of all persons making confidential recommendations. Such recommendations will be used only for the purpose for which they were specifically intended. A waiver may be revoked by the student in writing at any time and the revocation will apply to all subsequent recommendations.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br>

	<br>
	<span><span><span><span>A student’s request to inspect and review his or her records shall be made in writing (whether or not the student personally appears) and shall identify the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The request should be addressed to the Director of Student Services at the relevant educational institution.</span></span></span></span><br>
	<br>
	<span><span><span><span>The Institution will provide access within a reasonable period of time but not more than forty‑five (45) days after it has received the request. The Director of Student Services will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected.</span></span></span></span><br>
	<br>
	<span><span><span><span>The Institution may require the presence of an Institution official during the inspection and review of a student’s records.</span></span></span></span><br>
	<br>
	<span><span><span><span>If circumstances effectively prevent the parent or eligible student from being able to inspect and review the records, a copy of the record may be provided or other arrangements may be made for the individual to inspect the records. A fee of 25 cents per page may be assessed unless Universal Technical Institute determines such cost would prevent the student’s access to the records. In such cases, the fee may be reduced or waived.</span></span></span></span><br>
	<br>
	<span><span><span><span>The Institution will respond to reasonable requests from the student for explanations and interpretations of records inspected and reviewed.</span></span></span></span><br>
	<br>
	<span><span><span><span>The Institute will not destroy any education records if there is an outstanding request to inspect and review the records.</span></span></span></span><br>
	<br>
	<span><span><span><span>No fees will be charged to search for or to retrieve the education records of a student in response to requests made in accordance with this policy.</span></span></span></span><br>

	<br>
	<span><span><span><span>A student who believes that information contained in his or her educational records is inaccurate or misleading, or violates his or her privacy may request that the Institution amend the records. The Institution will decide whether to do so within a reasonable period of time. If the Institution declines to amend the student’s records, it will inform <span>the</span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span>student of that decision and the student’s right to a<span> hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>A hearing may not be requested by a student to contest the assignment of a grade unless the grade was recorded inaccurately in the student’s record.</span></span></span></span><br>
	&nbsp;
	<p class="MsoBodyText"><span><span><span><span>If as a result of a hearing the Institution determines that a student’s record is not inaccurate, misleading or otherwise in violation of the privacy rights of the student, the <span>Institution&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>will inform the student of his or her right to place a statement in the record commenting on the contested information&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>in the record or stating why he or she disagrees with the Institution’s decision. Any such explanation will be kept as part of the student’s record as long as the contested portion of the record is kept and will be disclosed whenever the contested portion of the record is disclosed.</span></span></span></span><br>
	<br>
	<span><span><span><span>If as a result of a hearing the Institute determines a student’s record is inaccurate, misleading or otherwise in violation&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>of the privacy rights of the student, the Institution shall amend the record accordingly and inform the student of the amendment in writing.</span></span></span></span></p>

	<br>
	<span><span><span><span>Generally, the Institution may not disclose education records or personally identifiable information from education records to anyone other than the student without prior consent of</span></span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span><span>the student. The consent must be written, signed and dated, and must specify the records to be disclosed, the purpose of the disclosure, and the party to whom the disclosure may be made.

	<br>
	<span><span><span><span>The Institution may only disclose education records without prior written student consent if it redacts all personally identifiable information such that the student’s identity</span></span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span><span>is not personally identifiable or, under certain limited circumstances, to include:</span></span></span></span></p>

A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review the education record in order to fulfill his or her instructional, supervisory, advisory, administrative, or</span></span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span><span>other authorized professional responsibilities or duties for the educational Institution.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li class="MsoBodyText"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Disclosures to officials of other schools in which a student seeks or intends to enroll or is enrolled as long as the disclosure is for purposes related to the student’s enrollment or transfer.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li class="MsoBodyText"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Disclosures to authorized representatives of the Comptroller General of the United States, the Attorney General of the United States, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education, and state and local educational authorities, but only in connection with an audit or evaluation of federally or state‑supported educational program, or for the enforcement of or compliance with federal legal requirements relating to those programs.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li class="MsoBodyText"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Disclosures in connection with financial aid for which the student has applied or which the student has received,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span><span>if the information is necessary to determine eligibility, amount of the aid, the conditions of aid or enforcement of terms or conditions of the aid.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li class="MsoBodyText">Disclosures to state and local officials to which such information is specifically required to be reported by effective state law if the disclosure concerns the juvenile justice system and the system’s ability to effectively serve the student whose records are released. With respect to such laws adopted after Nov. 19, 1974, the recipients of the information shall certify in writing to the Institute that the information will not be disclosed to any other party (except as provided under state law) without the prior written consent of the student.</li>
