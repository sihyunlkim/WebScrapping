         <P>MITnet is the set of MIT-owned network devices a)
         connecting the MIT campus to the global Internet, and b)
         providing access to almost all MIT departments, offices,
         research labs and centers. The MIT community's use of this
         network are governed by the <A HREF="http://mit.edu/olh/Rules/#mitnet">MITnet
         Rules of Use</A>.</P>
         
         <P>In addition, there are specific rules which apply to
         Residential Networking. So, if you have have an MITnet
         connection in your living space -- dorm, or otherwise, you
         should look at <A HREF="http://web/rescomp/www/mitnet-policies.html">Residential
         Network @ MIT: Network Policies</A>.</P>
         
         <P>Likewise, if you have questions about local area

         clusters, and the thousands of residential locations, and
         via dialup services, to any authorized member of the MIT
         community off-campus as well. All authorized users of an MIT

         systems are intended to be connected to MITnet, there are a
         set of requirements provided for interoperation with the MIT

         <P>This concerns who and how one may gain access to a

         account. There are several answers to this, one of which is
         about central MITnet / Athena Accounts, The policy for such
         accounts is detailed in <A HREF="http://mit.edu/olh/Welcome/accounts.html">Accounts
         Procedures</A>. Accounts on departmental systems <U>may</U>

         by, stored in and disseminated from automated systems, as
         well as the traffic that is carried by MITnet.</P>
         
         <P>The most important of these policies is the <A HREF="http://mit.edu/policies/sip/">Student

         <P>MIT's Student Information Policy governs the
         circumstances under which, and the persons to whom, student
         information may be disclosed, as well as students' rights to
         access their own records and to challenge their accuracy. As
         required by federal law, this policy includes the rights and
         privacy protections provided by the Family Educational
         Rights and Privacy Act (Title 20, U.S. Code, section 1232g,

         <H1>Privacy</H1>
         
         <P>MIT has a long-standing tradition of being on the
         forefront of concerns about individual privacy. The
         <A HREF="http://mit.edu/policies/11.0.html">MIT Policy on
         Privacy</A> reflects this tradition. Beyond MIT, there are
         ongoing debates about what privacy is, what it means in
         various contexts, and how it might be enforced, or ensured.
         We would recommend to anyone Privacy International's
         thoroughly documented site on this topic.</P>
         
         <P>For our purposes, we feel that one definition that has
         stood the test of time is this one written in 1967 by Alan
         Westin in this seminal work "Privacy and Freedom:"</P>
         
         <DL>
            <DD>"...privacy is the desire of people to choose freely
            under what circumstances and to what extent they will
            expose themselves, their attitudes and their behavior to
            others."</DD>
