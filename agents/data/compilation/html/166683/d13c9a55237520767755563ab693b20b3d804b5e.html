<p><b>Eligibility and Prerequisites. </b>All courses listed here are open to members
of the MIT community. Certain courses may have additional eligibility criteria,
based on content, authorizations (as for SAP), or prerequisite knowledge. This
knowledge is your responsibility. If you are unsure of your readiness for a particular
course, use a needs assessment tool (e.g., IS, EHS offer these) or contact the
group providing the training to inquire about eligibility. </p>
<p><b>Release Time. </b>Supervisors are encouraged to promote the professional development
of their employees by recommending enrollment in training courses. Time away
from the regular work location during working hours may be given (with pay) for
attendance in these training programs. </p>
<p><b>Enrollment Priorities &amp; Class Size. </b>Enrollment is on a first-come, first-served
basis. Class size is limited and depends on the instructor's preference.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Waiting Lists. </b>If a course is full when you apply, you can submit a request
to be put on the waiting list for that section of the course. If you remain on
the course wait list and do not get a spot in that section of the course, your
name will automatically go on a prebook list. All of the people on a prebook
list will be contacted when the next session of that course is scheduled, and
you will have the choice at that time to register for the upcoming section of
the course. </p>
<p><b>Cancellations. </b>If you must cancel your registration in a course, please do
so as early as possible so the next person on the waiting list can take your
place in the course. If you do not cancel your registration, your attendance
will be recorded as a "no-show." In order for your attendance to not be recorded
as a "no-show," you must cancel your registration before 12:00 noon on the day
before your course begins. </p>
<p><b>Schedule and Location Changes. </b>Dates, times, and locations of these courses
are listed on the web, but are subject to change. Check your confirmation emails
closely for any changes. </p>
<p><b>Cost / Payment. </b>Most of the MIT courses described on this website are currently
offered free of charge to members of the MIT community. Exceptions include advanced
information technology training and some courses that have extensive course materials.
Any costs associated with a course are noted in the course descriptions. </p>
<p><i>Note: </i>Most fee-based courses listed here are not covered by the MIT <a href="http://web.mit.edu/hr/careers/ta/">Tuition
Assistance Plan </a>, which is intended for more extensive training and education. </p>
