<p align="center"><strong><u>SUPPLEMENT  TO MIT PROCEDURES DEALING WITH</u></strong><br>
    <strong><u>ACADEMIC   MISCONDUCT</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>In addition to those set forth in &quot;MIT  Procedures for Dealing with Academic Misconduct,&quot; the following  requirements apply to allegations arising from the conduct of research  sponsored by federal agencies.&nbsp; Copies of  referenced documents may be obtained from the Vice President for Research and  Associate Provost or from the Director of the Office of Sponsored  Programs.&nbsp; When allegations of research  misconduct involve research funded by federal agencies, the federal policy  should be reviewed carefully in addition to noting the procedures and  requirements covered in this supplement.&nbsp;  For federal agencies not mentioned in this supplement, the Vice  President for Research and Associate Provost will consult the relevant agency  to obtain the agency&rsquo;s policy if there is one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The federal Office of  Science and Technology Policy issued a final Federal research misconduct policy  on December 6, 2000 in 65 FR 76260-76264.&nbsp;  The Federal policy consists of a definition of research misconduct and  basic guidelines to help Federal agencies and Federally funded research  institutions respond to allegations of research misconduct.&nbsp; The policy directs Federal agencies that  support or conduct research to implement the Federal policy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to the issuance  of the Federal-wide policy referenced above, only two agencies (the Public  Health Service and the National Science Foundation) had adopted formal policies  on research misconduct.&nbsp; This Supplement  incorporates the NSF revisions of 2002 and PHS revisions of 2005.&nbsp; In cases, involving any other Federal  agencies, the Vice President for Research should be consulted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION - REGULATIONS ON MISCONDUCT</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NSF regulations,  which became effective July 1, 1987, were published in the Federal Register,  Volume 52, pages 24486 ff. on July 1, 1987, and amended on May 14, 1991  (Federal Register, Volume 56, pages 22287 ff) and on April 17, 2002 (Federal  Register, Volume 67, pages 11936 ff).&nbsp;  The NSF regulations are contained at 45 CFR 689, &ldquo;Misconduct in Science  and Engineering Research&rdquo; as modified by the April 17, 2002 issuance in the  Federal Register.</p>
<p><strong>General Policies</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NSF statement of  general policies and responsibilities with respect to misconduct are set forth  in Section 689.&nbsp; The National Science  Foundation has adopted the government-wide definition of research misconduct as  follows:</p>

<p><strong>Role of NSF</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The initial handling  of alleged misconduct matters by NSF staff who learn of it and the subsequent  role of the NSF Office of the Inspector General (OIG) are covered in Section  689.5.&nbsp; The role of OIG in deferring or initiating  an NSF inquiry or investigation and the procedures involved in such  investigations are also covered in Section 689.5.&nbsp; The role of OIG in notifying NSF officials of  alleged misconduct and the circumstances under which reviewers and panelists  will be informed are set forth in Section 689.7.&nbsp; The interim actions that NSF may take to  protect Federal interests are set forth in Section 689.8, and the possible  actions that NSF may take upon a determination that misconduct has occurred under  an NSF award are set forth in Section 689.9.</p>
<p><strong>Role of Awardee Institution</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NSF policy  provides that &quot;Awardee institutions bear primary responsibility for  prevention and detection of research misconduct and for the inquiry,  investigation, and adjudication of alleged research misconduct.&quot;&nbsp; Section 689.4 sets out the role of the  awardee institution with respect to initiating an inquiry and conducting an  investigation and the steps to be taken if the institution wishes NSF to defer  independent inquiry or investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Disposition and Appeal</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The review and  disposition within NSF of the report from an investigation is covered in  Section 689.9 and depends upon whether the report confirms or fails to confirm  the alleged misconduct.&nbsp; As stated in  Section 689.10 appeals may be made to the NSF director.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE &ndash; RESEARCH MISCONDUCT</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The applicable  requirements are set forth in a Final Rule issued in the Federal Register dated  May 17, 2005; 42 CFR Parts 50 and 93. This final rule removes 42 CFR part 50,  subpart A. Requirements not already reflected in the MIT Policy Statement on  Academic Misconduct, Policies and Procedures, Section 10.1 are set forth  below.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Research Misconduct</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Research</strong> <strong>Misconduct</strong> is  fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing  research, or in reporting research results. It does not include honest error or  differences of opinion.&nbsp; A finding of  research misconduct requires that there be a significant departure from  accepted practices of the relevant research community, the misconduct be  committed intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, and the allegation be proven  by a preponderance of the evidence.&nbsp; A  preponderance of the evidence is defined as proof by information that, compared  with that opposing it, leads to the conclusion that the fact at issue is more  probably true than not.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An Inquiry </strong>is<strong> </strong>preliminary  information gathering and preliminary fact-finding that meets the criteria and  follows the procedures of &sect; 93.307 &ndash; 93.309.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>An Investigation </strong>is<strong> </strong>the  formal development of a factual record and the examination of that record  leading to a decision not to make a finding of research misconduct or to a  recommendation for a finding of research misconduct which may include a  recommendation for other appropriate actions, including administrative  actions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Inquiry</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An inquiry must be  completed within 60 calendar days of its initiation unless circumstances  clearly warrant a longer period.&nbsp; If the  inquiry takes longer than 60 days, the record of the inquiry shall include  documentation of the reasons for exceeding the 60-day period.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a decision is made that an investigation  is not warranted the institution must keep sufficiently detailed documentation  to permit a later assessment of the reasons for determining that an investigation  was not warranted.&nbsp; The records will be  maintained in a secure manner in the Office of the Vice President for Research  for a period of seven years after the termination of the inquiry, and shall,  upon request, be provided to ORI or other authorized Health and Human Service  (HHS) personnel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice of the results  of the Inquiry to the respondent must include a copy of or refer to CFR parts  50 and 93 as well as to the institution&rsquo;s policies and procedures adopted under  its assurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>If an institution plans to terminate an inquiry or investigation</strong> for any reason without completing all relevant requirements of the final rule  cited above, a report of such planned termination, including a description of  the reasons for such termination, shall be made to the National Institutes of  Health (NIH) Office of Research Integrity (ORI), which will then decide whether  further investigation should be undertaken.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Investigation</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An institution's  decision to initiate an investigation must be reported in writing to the  Director of ORI on or before the date that an investigation begins.&nbsp; At a minimum the notification should  include:&nbsp; the name of the person(s)  against whom the allegations have been made, the general nature of the  allegation(s), and the PHS application or award number(s) involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information provided  through the notification will be held in confidence to the extent permitted by  law, will not be disclosed as part of the peer review and Advisory Committee  review processes, but may be used by the Secretary in making decisions about  the award or continuation of funding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>An investigation must be initiated</strong> within 30 days after determining  that an investigation is warranted. The Director of ORI must be notified on or  before the date the investigation begins and provided an inquiry report as  described above.&nbsp; The investigation  should be thorough, sufficiently documented, and include examination of all  research records and evidence relevant to reaching a decision on the merits of  the allegations.&nbsp; Steps should be taken  to ensure an impartial and unbiased investigation to the maximum extent  practicable, including participation of persons with appropriate scientific  expertise who do not have unresolved personal, professional, or financial  conflicts of interest with those involved with the inquiry or  investigation.&nbsp; Interviews will include  each respondent, complainant, and any other available person who has been  reasonably identified as having information regarding any relevant aspects of  the investigation, including witnesses identified by the respondent.&nbsp; Interviews should be recorded or transcribed  and the recording or transcription must be provided to the interviewer for  correction, and must be included in the record of the investigation.&nbsp; All significant issues and leads relevant to  the investigation, including any evidence of additional instances of possible  research misconduct should be pursued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>An investigation must ordinarily be completed</strong> within 120 days of  its initiation.&nbsp; This includes conducting  the investigation, preparing the report of findings, making that report  available for comment by the subjects of the investigation, and submitting the  report to the ORI.&nbsp; If unable to complete  the investigation in 120 days, the institution must ask ORI for an extension in  writing.&nbsp; ORI may direct the institution  to file periodic progress reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The investigation  report submitted to the ORI must include items a-g of &sect;93.313 and the  institution must maintain and provide to ORI upon request all relevant research  records and records of the institution&rsquo;s research misconduct proceeding,  including results of all interviews and the transcripts or recordings of such  interviews.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conducting its  review of misconduct proceedings, the ORI may review the information in order  to determine whether the investigation has been performed in a timely manner  and with sufficient objectivity, thoroughness and competence to support the  conclusions.&nbsp; The ORI may then request  clarification or additional information and, if necessary, perform its own  investigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Documentation will be  maintained in the Office of the Vice President for Research to substantiate the  findings of the investigation.&nbsp; This  documentation will be made available to the ORI Director, who will decide whether  that office will either proceed with its own investigation or will act on the  institution's findings.&nbsp; Such records  shall be maintained for a period of at least seven years after PHS acceptance  of the final report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Protecting Federal  Interests:</u>&nbsp; The institution will (1)  take interim administrative actions, as appropriate, to protect Federal funds  and insure that the purposes of the Federal financial assistance are carried  out, and (2) keep the ORI apprised of any developments during the course of the  investigation which disclose facts that may affect current or potential  Department of Health and Human Services funding for the individual(s) under  investigation or that the PHS needs to know to ensure appropriate use of  Federal funds and otherwise protect the public interest.</p>
<p><strong>Special Notifications</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The institution is  responsible for notifying the ORI immediately if it ascertains at any stage of  the inquiry or investigation that any of the following conditions exist:</p>
